The latest attempt on his life came just last month when the IDF struck Qatar in a futile attempt to tip the scales in stalled peace talks.\n\nBut the Israeli bombs that struck Doha on Sept 9 missed their target. In fact, the attack misfired so spectacularly that it not only failed to kill al-Hayya or any of his fellow Hamas leaders, but also forced Israel's reluctant prime minister to accept the deal Mr Trump furiously imposed on him in the strike's aftermath.\n\nSo instead, al-Hayya finds himself in Sharm el-Sheikh, the resort city of Egypt's Red Sea riviera, negotiating the finer details of Mr Trump's 20-point plan to bring \"eternal peace\" to the Middle East.\n\nWhile al-Hayya has been lucky in avoiding Israel's strikes many of his relatives have been less fortunate.

The 88-year-old Pulitzer-winning journalist has an impressive resumé. It was Hersh who broke the story, in 1969, of the horrific US army massacre of Vietnamese civilians at My Lai, invigorating the US anti-war movement; 35 years later, his reports for the New Yorker revealed the gruesome extent of US military torture at Abu Ghraib.\n\nIt's also not hard to see why it took Hersh a full two decades to agree to make Cover-Up, Poitras's new documentary, co-directed with Mark Obenhaus, on Hersh's six-plus decades digging up the stories buried by those in power. An old-school reporter who has courted controversy for his extensive use of anonymous sources, Hersh is a prickly and resistant subject, reluctant to relive the past yet eager to excoriate abuses of power with a torrent of reporting.\n\nBut he makes a wry, undaunted and absolutely scathing guide through 60-plus years of US government abuses, from indiscriminate killing in Vietnam to underwriting Israel's massacre of civilians in Gaza. As in All the Beauty and the Bloodshed, Poitras's outstanding 2022 film on artist Nan Goldin's efforts to remove the Sackler name from the prestigious art galleries that managed to weave together the opioid crisis, Aids activism and personal history into a singular narrative, Cover-Up demonstrates Poitras's genius for structure. The 117-minute film, which premiered at the Venice film festival, proceeds chronologically through Hersh's most significant scoops and scattershot through his personal life, masterfully integrating his tart personal accounts with over half a century of shameful US history.\n\nCover-Up smartly spends large sections enmeshed not just in Hersh's process of reporting, but the reporting itself. It often plays, to its benefit, like a straightforward history documentary, relying on sharply edited and restored archival footage to evoke and educate on some of the US government's most ignominious recent chapters. Among them: My Lai, in which US soldiers raped and murdered hundreds of Vietnamese civilians, including infants; the CIA's illegal surveillance of the US student movement against the war in Vietnam; the CIA's illicit and ultimately failed attempts to breed their own Manchurian candidate via LSD; covert US involvement in the installment of fascist dictator Augusto Pinochet in Chile; the slow-motion executive car crash that was Watergate.\n\nAll the while there's Hersh, a consistent gadfly to the people in power, be they US presidents or executives of Gulf+Western or New York Times editors with a direct line to Henry Kissinger, feeding \"official source\" information to the daily pages like the Kris Jenner of foreign policy. (As Richard Nixon described Hersh in a call to Kissinger: \"This son of a bitch is a son of a bitch, but he's usually right, isn't he?\") Restless, kinetic, energized by the word no, he's quick to recite the facts and loath to put himself in the story. \"In case anyone cares, this is less and less fun,\" he says in what appears to be two sit-down interviews at his home office, surrounded by mountains of faded yellow legal pads. Soon after, fearing leaks of his anonymous sources, he (temporarily) quits the project entirely. Poitras coaxes out details of his upbringing - born to Jewish refugees from Lithuania and Poland, raised in an \"unthinking\" family on the south side of Chicago, expected to take over his father's dry cleaning shop - like pulled teeth.\n\nThat ironically makes for a pleasurable viewing experience, despite the utter atrocities at hand, though it does leave some trickier aspects of his career unexplored. The bulk of Hersh's career post-New York Times, in the 80s and 90s, go unmentioned, other than brief clips on the controversies surrounding some of his 11 books. Hersh, who now has a Substack newsletter (retirement seems like a foreign concept) is quick to admit when he was wrong, but the film is light on context. At one point, he acknowledges underestimating the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad's cruelty, but the film barely lingers on why that merits a mention (for years, Hersh maintained that the regime's sarin gas attacks on civilians were misattributed).\n\nBut whether inaccurate or, mostly, scarily accurate, Hersh's dogged pursuit of truth serves to underscore the film's point, framed by man's prolific ability to rationalize evil, to metabolize or celebrate or numb to unimaginable violence. In the past: a map of My Lai annotated by a US soldier - \"observed approx 50 bodies\" next to \"ate lunch.\" In the present: Hersh on the phone with a source in Gaza, poring over photographs of Israeli military plans on destroyed homes in Gaza, showing they know exactly where civilians are before they bomb them. Cover-Up adeptly illustrates the patterns of official cruelty: deny, downplay, quibble, destroy. Justify on the grounds of \"national security\". Repeat. \"We're a culture of enormous violence,\" Hersh remarks. \"You can't just have a country who does that and looks the other way.\" Brisk, lucid and sweeping, Cover-Up assures that some, at least, will not.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.258745344858321,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Richard Nixon\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"President of the United States\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"This son of a bitch is a son of a bitch, but he's usually right, isn't he?\",\n    \"message\": \"Richard Nixon acknowledged that journalist Seymour Hersh, while difficult to deal with, typically reported accurately.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Seymour Hersh\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"Journalist\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"In case anyone cares, this is less and less fun,\",\n    \"message\": \"Journalist Seymour Hersh expressed that the ongoing project or his work was becoming increasingly unenjoyable for him.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"US soldier\",\n    \"organisation\": \"US Army\",\n    \"role\": \"Soldier\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"observed approx 50 bodies\",\n    \"message\": \"A US Army soldier noted observing approximately 50 bodies on a map of My Lai.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"US soldier\",\n    \"organisation\": \"US Army\",\n    \"role\": \"Soldier\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"ate lunch.\",\n    \"message\": \"A US Army soldier noted eating lunch on a map, next to a notation about observed bodies in My Lai.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Seymour Hersh\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"Journalist\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"We're a culture of enormous violence,\",\n    \"message\": \"Journalist Seymour Hersh stated that the United States is a culture characterized by significant violence.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Seymour Hersh\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"Journalist\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"You can't just have a country who does that and looks the other way.\",\n    \"message\": \"Journalist Seymour Hersh asserted that a country cannot commit violent acts and then ignore them.\"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP"}],"createTime":"2025-10-15T10:36:59.779656Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"S3nvaIjLL5ObnvgPnq7G6AI","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":504,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":504}],"promptTokenCount":1578,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1578}],"thoughtsTokenCount":2119,"totalTokenCount":4201,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}}}

Like so many sunflowers, their faces turned up to search the clear blue morning sky for the source of the sound. Then it swept into view from the west, from the direction of Gaza.\n\nA helicopter, military brown, was on the way to Ichilov hospital a few hundred metres away. But it diverted. It circled around the crowd giving each person below a view, and then tilted to its right, in an apparent salute to the cheering, waving, smiling faces below.\n\nAt the door of the helicopter, the keen-eyed will have seen the outline of a figure almost hanging out, seemingly straining to get closer to the jubilant crowd below.\n\nIt appeared to be one of the final 20 live hostages released that morning after two years in Hamas captivity. He used his hands to make a shape: a heart.\n\nAbout eight helicopters in all swept by, not all of them diverting to put on a show. Some medical cases may have been more urgent than others.\n\nBut each received a raucous cheer on what was certainly a highly emotional day for Israel, and one that so many dearly hope will prove to be historic.\n\nThe square, nothing much to look at, on top of a car park close to the Israel Defense Forces headquarters, has been where the campaign to bring the hostages home has been led. The question now facing Israel is whether the release can lead to a lasting peace with Palestine.\n\n\"I always say that I hope so, you know, but this neighbourhood is not so much friendly,\" said Ayelet Lantzer, 63. \"I grew up in kibbutz Nir Oz, and was born there before the '67 war. There were days that we used to go to Gaza to eat hummus, and we went to the beach and we went to restaurants, and we had a very good relationship with the people there.\"\n\nNir Oz, less than 7km (four miles), was where Hamas took seven of the hostages on 7 October, of whom six came home alive on Monday as part of Donald Trump's 20-point Gaza plan. The seventh, Arie Zalmanowicz, 85, died in captivity.\n\nSince the first week of the war, Lantzer had organised for a permanent encampment on the square, a white tent with a few chairs and lots of posters, as part of an attempt to keep pressure on the Israeli government to prioritise the release of those taken.\n\nShe had seen no such effort on the part of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, she said - a common refrain. But this last hostage release did seemingly close a horrifying chapter, she suggested.\n\nAbout 1,200 people were killed on 7 October when Hamas launched their attacks and took 251 hostages. An estimated 67,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Gaza Strip since Israel launched its military response, the majority of whom were civilians, leading a UN commission to find Israel had committed genocide in Gaza.\n\nBut what next? Few on the square on Monday had any answers, but US president Donald Trump was insisting that the war was over - and certainly the overwhelming sentiment was relief.\n\nThat was certainly the feeling at 7.15am when Hamas issued their first statement of the day. It was the names of the 20 people they intended to release into the hands of the Red Cross. The first real proof for some that their beloved would return alive.\n\nImages on two big screens on two sides of the square allowed the thousands assembling to see the reaction of the families at Re'im military base near Gaza where they were waiting to be reunited with the lost and now found. The hugs and tears on the screen were echoed in the square.\n\nThis release was being chronicled in real time by Israeli broadcasters - and more extraordinary scenes were to follow.\n\nThere was word shortly after 8am that seven hostages had been released into the hands of the Red Cross. Then footage appeared on the large screens of jubilant parents receiving video calls from hostages not even among that first tranche. Hamas had apparently allowed them to make calls.\n\nJulie Kupershtein, the mother of hostage Bar Kupershtein, who was working at the Nova music festival as a paramedic on 7 October when he was taken, said: \"We were in the compound, and suddenly I had a conversation, suddenly I saw Bar. I screamed to the sky. Crazy. To see them, these pure, righteous children, alive. I'm shaking all over.\"\n\nFurther images emerged of pale smiling men. The first seven were with the army, it was announced from the stage on the square.\n\nThere were energetic renditions of \"Habayta\" (\"Home\") - a song that has become the anthem of the hostage crisis.\n\nThen it was Trump's perfectly scripted moment.\n\nThe large screen was split between images of the US president stepping on to Israeli soil from Air Force One and images of further released men, dark around the eyes, but looking reasonably physically fit.\n\n\"Trump did everything,\" said Jude Frajdenrajch, 55, who had visited the square every Saturday since the war began as word of the release of the final 13 emerged.\n\nThere were chants of the US president's name and one woman held aloft a placard carrying the words: \"Trump's list\", a seeming nod to the famous Schindler's list that saved Jews during the Holocaust.\n\nAnother piece of the deal was Israeli ministers' approval of the release of 1,718 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, including 250 terror convicts serving one or more life sentences.\n\nAt lunchtime Palestinian media outlets published footage showing the arrival of some of them in Ramallah in the West Bank. All seemed to be going to plan - and then a problem.\n\nHamas had been due to release the bodies of 28 killed Israeli hostages. But they only appeared able to provide four of them.\n\nIt was suggested that the carnage in Gaza had left them unable to locate the buried. It was fodder for the hardline within Netanyahu's Likud party.\n\n\"Hamas's announcement of the expected return of four bodies today constitutes a failure to meet its commitments,\" said defence minister Israel Katz, adding that \"any delay or deliberate avoidance will be considered a blatant violation of the agreement and will be met accordingly\".\n\nThe families of the deceased were also understandably distraught. \"From the people of Israel I ask - please, do not forget us,\" said Yael Adar, the mother of Tamir Adar, 38, whose body was taken from kibbutz Nir Oz on 7 October. \"Take action, demand [their return]. We need you more than ever. The struggle is not over until the last captive returns. It is absolutely forbidden to accept the violation of the agreement.\"\n\nThis was not something that the Americans were going to let upset Trump's perfect day. On his arrival at the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, where he was due to give a speech, Trump wrote a message in the guest book: \"This is my great honour - a great and beautiful day. A new beginning.\"\n\nAfter a lengthy speech from Netanyahu in which he criticised the rest of the world for failing to stand by Israel and inevitably heaped praise on Trump, it was time for the US president to speak. And did he speak.\n\nHe was cheered roundly as he stood in the parliament and outside on the square, and many laughed with him as he began his typically eccentric address. \"Nice place,\" Trump told the members of parliament. Was he considering a new real estate deal? \"The long and painful nightmare is finally over,\" he added.\n\nThe attention of the crowd in the square nevertheless appeared to drift off as Trump meandered into various rabbit holes including criticising Joe Biden, praising a top donor, Miriam Adelson, and making the familiar claim that the Ukraine war \"would never have happened if I had been president\". He also urged the Knesset to give Netanyahu a pardon over the corruption charges he is facing.\n\nTrump invited Netanyahu to join him at a peace conference in Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt. The Israeli prime minister declined the offer due to it being a holiday period. There is also an international criminal court warrant for his arrest, and it was reported that the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, threatened to boycott the summit if Netanyahu attended.\n\nA powerfully emotional day then but perhaps one that also offers some signs of its vulnerability to the character flaws of leading figures.\n\nShirley Bar Natahan, 44, had tears in her eyes on the square as she watched images of hostages being reunited with their children, wives and mothers. She had been here every Saturday for two years. This was a very good day for all the pitfalls, she said.\n\n\"There's nothing more important than this,\" she said. \"I think that if we, if this, didn't happen, I feel like Israel would not have the right to exist. This is why we exist so the Jews can have a safe place to bring everybody home.\"</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.18839703988337864,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Ayelet Lantzer\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"ISR\",\n    \"quote\": \"I always say that I hope so, you know, but this neighbourhood is not so much friendly.

Imagine it in the hands of a Farage government\n\nIn Britain, protest is no longer a right. Instead, it is a privilege that is granted - or withheld - at the whim of those in power. This is the implication of new rules that the Labour government is proposing, which would dictate the time and place that protests are permitted to occur, and carry the risk of prison time for those who defy orders. Successive governments had already chipped away at this right: the last Conservative administration granted the police sweeping new powers, which the United Nations' human rights chief condemned as \"serious and undue restrictions\" on democratic freedoms. Taken together, these incremental assaults on freedom have effectively abolished the hard-won right to freedom of protest.\n\nThe latest assault is justified by last week's heinous antisemitic attack on a mosque in Manchester. There should be universal agreement that the security of British Jews must be protected. Using this atrocity as a justification to throttle dissent is not only unrelated to that duty, but perverts it. Consider Britain's history of protest and direct action against racism and fascism, from the battle of Cable Street in 1936, to postwar Jewish anti-fascist movements such as the 43 or 62 Group, or the mobilisations against the National Front in the 1970s. Many of these protesters were derided as extremists in their day, even while they were fighting for the rights of minorities.\n\nIn today's upside-down world, here's what is actually going on. Israel - a foreign state - is committing genocide. Its war crimes have led the international criminal court to issue arrest warrants against Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defence minister. Public opinion in the west has turned sharply against Israel's violence. In Britain, a large majority of people believe Israel has likely committed war crimes. Most people would back a total ban on arms sales to the state, and support the arrest of Netanyahu.\n\nHaving long since lost the argument, Israel's cheerleaders are now seizing on a vile antisemitic crime to try to silence a mass movement against a moral catastrophe. The British government are included in this. Ministers have failed to impose large-scale sanctions on Israel, and have allowed arms exports to continue. As the US author Ta-Nehisi Coates recently said of the Democrats, \"if you can't draw the line at genocide, you probably can't draw the line at democracy\". The same applies to the Labour government.\n\nPeople who are protesting against the erasure of Gaza have been deemed hateful extremists. But there is a reason that there hasn't been a more extensive crackdown on these protesters before now. The former cabinet minister Penny Mordaunt recently claimed that demonstrators were calling for \"death to Jews\", but the reality is that so few protesters have made hateful (and thus illegal) statements about Jews that the police have had no reason to crack down on them. Meanwhile, Jewish protesters marching for Palestinian lives have been slandered. After one such protester told the BBC that he had joined every protest for the last two years, Ben Houchen, a non-Jewish Tory Lord, called him a \"useful idiot\".\n\nCollapsing Jewish identity into the actions of the Israeli state is not only cynical, it is dangerous. The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism, adopted by the British government and many other institutions, has been rightly challenged for stifling critique of Israel. But there should be no controversy over one of its examples: that \"holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel\" is antisemitic. Despite this, Israel's defenders have repeatedly attempted to conflate criticisms of Israel with antisemitic attacks on all Jewish communities, regardless of what many Jewish people make of these actions.\n\nThis is why we're now at a point where the Metropolitan police can suggest that protests opposing Israel's crimes should be called off on the basis that they could \"inadvertently or deliberately\" endorse antisemitism, and why why Priti Patel, the Conservative shadow foreign secretary, has declared that Labour's belated recognition of Palestinian statehood had rendered the party \"complicit in the appalling abuse we see across our streets and across Britain's Jewish community\".\n\nOn the same day as the synagogue attack, the Israeli army killed at least 57 Palestinians in Gaza - another hideous tally in two years of daily atrocities that have left tens of thousands dead. British politicians and media outlets have barely concealed the lack of value they attach to Palestinian life. It is among the most brazen expressions of racism of our time. One wonders how history will judge this moment: politicians are accusing people who are protesting against genocide of inciting hatred, while they are supporting those who are committing genocide.\n\nOur government has already crossed a dangerous threshold by proscribing Palestine Action, a non-violent, anti-genocide direct action group. More than 2,000 British protesters have been arrested, mostly for holding placards opposing genocide and supporting the banned organisation. Many of them are pensioners; one is a retired priest, another the daughter of a Holocaust survivor. When the state begins calling movements \"terrorism\" when they are nothing of the sort, it is attacking democracy itself.\n\nIt's not hard to see where this all leads. In the US, Democrats helped to demonise pro-Palestinian protests: the former house speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested that some were \"connected to Russia\", while Joe Biden called such protests antisemitic. In doing so, they only helped to legitimise the authoritarian crackdown on such protests - and on freedom of expression in general - under Donald Trump. If Nigel Farage becomes prime minister, a hard-right government would be granted sweeping powers to control dissent. What do you think a Reform government would do with this repressive toolkit? Our ancestors struggled, suffered and died to secure our freedoms. We will come to rue how casually we let them go.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.219768672026405,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"The United Nations' Human Rights Chief\",\n    \"organisation\": \"United Nations\",\n    \"role\": \"Human Rights Chief\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"serious and undue restrictions\",\n    \"message\": \"Actions taken by the previous Conservative administration constituted serious and undue restrictions on democratic freedoms.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Ta-Nehisi Coates\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"author\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"if you can't draw the line at genocide, you probably can't draw the line at democracy\",\n    \"message\": \"If one cannot oppose genocide, one likely cannot uphold democracy.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Penny Mordaunt\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Conservative Party\",\n    \"role\": \"former cabinet minister\",\n    \"nationality\": \"GBR\",\n    \"quote\": \"death to Jews\",\n    \"message\": \"Some demonstrators were calling for the death of Jewish people.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Ben Houchen\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Conservative Party\",\n    \"role\": \"Tory Lord\",\n    \"nationality\": \"GBR\",\n    \"quote\": \"useful idiot\",\n    \"message\": \"A person who joined protests for Palestinian lives was referred to as a 'useful idiot'.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance\",\n    \"organisation\": \"International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel\",\n    \"message\": \"It is antisemitic to hold Jewish people collectively responsible for the actions of the state of Israel.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Metropolitan Police\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Metropolitan Police\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"GBR\",\n    \"quote\": \"inadvertently or deliberately\",\n    \"message\": \"Protests opposing Israel's crimes could inadvertently or deliberately endorse antisemitism.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Priti Patel\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Conservative Party\",\n    \"role\": \"Conservative shadow foreign secretary\",\n    \"nationality\": \"GBR\",\n    \"quote\": \"complicit in the appalling abuse we see across our streets and across Britain's Jewish community\",\n    \"message\": \"Labour's recognition of Palestinian statehood has made the party complicit in the appalling abuse seen across British streets and within the Jewish community.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Nancy Pelosi\",\n    \"organisation\": \"US House of Representatives\",\n    \"role\": \"former house speaker\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"connected to Russia\",\n    \"message\": \"Some pro-Palestinian protests are connected to Russia.\"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP"}],"createTime":"2025-10-15T10:36:59.704062Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"S3nvaL78KpObnvgPnq7G6AI","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":645,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":645}],"promptTokenCount":1615,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1615}],"thoughtsTokenCount":2866,"totalTokenCount":5126,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}}}

She said: \"It is utterly shameful that so many universities have spent time and resources surveilling students who are engaged in peaceful protest against a genocide, and that some have seemingly done so on the say-so of defence companies.\"\n\nThere have been large-scale pro-Palestinian protests by students on campuses across the UK in the past two years and demonstrations at careers fairs against companies with Israeli government links.\n\nThe Association of University Chief Security Officers (Aucso) launched a coordinated effort to prevent protests \"affecting our students' career advancement\", according to notes released under FoI laws from a January 2025 presentation by Aucso to Universities UK, the body representing vice-chancellors.\n\nAucso, which has security staff at more than 140 universities, wrote that its members \"monitor[ed] media/social media\" and deployed \"static officers (at entrance points near the targeted company) and mobile officers (to monitor surrounding areas and for rapid response)\" during events.\n\nAucso security staff also used bodycams to capture video for \"legal/disciplinary proceedings\", among other measures, the email said.\n\nAucso was approached for comment.\n\nDefence companies that individually raised concerns with institutions before careers fairs about the potential for protests were offered reassurance, emails suggest.\n\nLoughborough University told a recruitment firm running a \"Rolls-Royce roadshow\" that its security team were conducting \"active monitoring of social media ... to provide early intelligence about protests\". It was doing so, it wrote, as \"protest has been a concern for employers in recent times\".\n\nA Loughborough University spokesperson said previous masked protests by Loughborough Action for Palestine (LAFP), a group that says it is made up of staff, students and alumni, had caused some students to feel unsafe amid allegations of antisemitism.\n\n\"We observe the group's public feed occasionally so as to forewarn those who may be affected in advance of any protests. We are unapologetic for this. We do not surveil students' social media,\" they said.\n\nLAFP responded in a statement: \"We are extremely concerned but unsurprised that a few peaceful protests on campus have been perceived as threats to student safety and have been weaponised to 'justify' surveillance of students by university management.\"\n\nRolls-Royce declined to comment.\n\nEmails from Heriot-Watt University (HWU) suggest Raytheon UK asked the university to \"monitor university chat groups\" on its behalf before a careers fair, prompting the university to agree to \"implement the measures you have suggested\".\n\nA HWU spokesperson said the university \"strongly refuted\" any claims it monitored students' private correspondence, adding that safeguarding staff did not have access to any student chat groups or online discussion forums. The university did not provide further explanation for its response to the arms company. Raytheon declined to comment.\n\nFurther emails suggest BAE Systems required Glasgow university to complete security questions before agreeing to attend events. A \"university security questionnaire\" sent to Glasgow by the defence company asked if the institution was \"aware of any social media protests posts or videos\".\n\nIn May this year, Glasgow university's careers service staff met the arms firm Leonardo, whose employee afterwards wrote: \"It's reassuring to know that we're not going to have the [sic] step back because we can't find a route to engaging with students and keep [sic] our staff safe.\"\n\nLeonardo was approached for comment. The University of Glasgow did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn February 2024, Cardiff University moved its career event online \"in agreement with BAE\" after staff spotted a social media post calling for a protest, emails show.\n\nA Cardiff University spokesperson said: \"We reject the suggestion that we've put students 'under surveillance'. The protest was posted on a public-facing social media account. This was picked up as part of our day-to-day media monitoring.\n\n\"We routinely monitor mentions of Cardiff University, including those made on social media platforms, to measure engagement with our communications activity and in relation to reputation management. This type of activity is not unique to Cardiff University and is used by other universities and organisations.\"\n\nBAE Systems said it did not directly sell weapons to Israel. It declined to comment further. The UK does supply BAE-made components to a global pool of F-35 jets that Israel can access.\n\nAlmost one in four (37 out of 154) UK universities launched disciplinary investigations into pro-Gaza student and staff activists between October 2023 and March 2025, with up to 200 people affected, data compiled by Liberty Investigates shows.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.5165295674704915,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Jo Grady\",\n    \"organisation\": \"University and College Union\",\n    \"role\": \"general secretary\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"should be supported by their universities, not surveilled by them\",\n    \"message\": \"Student protesters should receive support from their universities instead of being surveilled by them.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Jo Grady\",\n    \"organisation\": \"University and College Union\",\n    \"role\": \"general secretary\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"It is utterly shameful that so many universities have spent time and resources surveilling students who are engaged in peaceful protest against a genocide, and that some have seemingly done so on the say-so of defence companies.\",\n    \"message\": \"It is completely disgraceful that many universities have invested time and resources into surveilling students who are peacefully protesting against genocide, especially when some appear to have done so at the behest of defence companies.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Association of University Chief Security Officers\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Association of University Chief Security Officers\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"monitor[ed] media/social media\",\n    \"message\": \"The members of the Association of University Chief Security Officers monitored media and social media.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Association of University Chief Security Officers\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Association of University Chief Security Officers\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"static officers (at entrance points near the targeted company) and mobile officers (to monitor surrounding areas and for rapid response)\",\n    \"message\": \"The Association of University Chief Security Officers deployed static security officers at entrance points near targeted companies and mobile officers to monitor surrounding areas for rapid response during events.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Association of University Chief Security Officers\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Association of University Chief Security Officers\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"legal/disciplinary proceedings\",\n    \"message\": \"Bodycams were used by security staff for legal and disciplinary proceedings.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Loughborough University\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Loughborough University\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"active monitoring of social media ... to provide early intelligence about protests\",\n    \"message\": \"Loughborough University's security team conducted active monitoring of social media to gather early intelligence regarding protests.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Loughborough University\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Loughborough University\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"protest has been a concern for employers in recent times\",\n    \"message\": \"Protest activity has recently been a concern for employers.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Loughborough University spokesperson\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Loughborough University\",\n    \"role\": \"spokesperson\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"We observe the group's public feed occasionally so as to forewarn those who may be affected in advance of any protests.

If Israel's PM can scupper the plan, he will\n\nAfter so many images of death and devastation, what sweet relief to see pictures of joy. On the world's TV news broadcasts, the screen was split on Thursday: celebrations in Gaza and celebrations in Israel, the scenes of cheering and clapping mirroring each other, as if to confirm that this was a war the peoples themselves wanted over long ago - and which most never wanted to begin.\n\nThe images were not unfamiliar. We had seen a version of them in January, when a ceasefire was announced to great jubilation. That held only until mid-March, when Israel broke the agreement and resumed its bombardment of Gaza, an experience that should temper, and caveat, the current hope with the knowledge that things can unravel at any moment. Still, this time, even the region's most seasoned pessimists concede, the deal looks more durable.\n\nSo how did it come about and who deserves the credit? Often a breakthrough such as this is the result of both parties shifting their positions, more or less equally. At first glance, it can seem as if that is what happened here. Hamas was clearly weakened, with Israel having eliminated its leaders and diminished its great patron, Iran. And Donald Trump ensured that those states with leverage over Hamas - Qatar, Turkey and Egypt - pushed the organisation to say yes. (He did that using tools uniquely held by the US, agreeing, for example, a defence pact with Qatar that gives the Gulf state Nato-level protection.)\n\nEven so, and despite the best efforts of Benjamin Netanyahu's advocates to suggest otherwise, Hamas was not forced to make a major shift in its stance. Trump's 20-point plan might call for the group to hand over its weapons, but Hamas has made no commitment on that and there is no mention of it in the current, fairly narrow ceasefire agreement billed as the first phase of the deal.\n\nFrom the start, the group said it would hand over the hostages it held once Israel agreed to release Palestinian prisoners, eventually withdraw its forces from Gaza and end the war. Sure, the withdrawal will be done in stages, but those three moves are what Israel has broadly agreed to. As Michael Milstein, a former colonel in Israeli military intelligence widely regarded as the country's foremost analyst of Hamas, put it to me when we spoke: \"Let's face it, Hamas didn't really change anything dramatically in its basic positions.\"\n\nIn other words, the big shift has been in the Israeli stance. Just a few days before Trump unveiled his plan at the White House with Netanyahu at his side, the Israeli prime minister was telling the UN in New York that the war would not end until Hamas was entirely destroyed. Now he has agreed to a deal that leaves Hamas in place. He has accepted what he had previously deemed unacceptable. What got him to do that?\n\nThe concise answer is that Donald Trump at last wielded the full might of his office and called time on the war. He left Netanyahu in no doubt that his patience had run out, confident that the Israeli PM had nowhere else to turn. Over the past two years, Netanyahu has shown the middle finger to everyone else - including Israel's historic friends and allies - leaving him dependent on Trump alone. If the US president said the war had to end, it had to end. As Trump himself told Netanyahu: \"Israel cannot fight the world.\"\n\nMost observers suspect that Trump decided to put his foot down after Israel's 9 September failed attack on the Hamas negotiating team in Doha. Trump took that as a personal affront. Not only did Netanyahu give him insufficient warning that Israel was planning to kill the very people with whom it needed to discuss an agreement, he did it on the sovereign territory of a country with which Trump has personal and financial ties: recall that the Qataris had gifted Trump a new plane to use as Air Force One. It was an act of hubris by Netanyahu. And, like a mafia don insulted by an attempted hit on one of his business associates, Trump decided it was time to remind the Israeli PM who was boss.\n\nThe US president also noted the loud protests on Israeli streets, as the public there demanded an end to the war, and the global outrage caused by Israel's shattering of Gaza, and calculated that brokering a ceasefire deal would bring him the kudos that, though he often affects to disdain international opinion, he craves. To say nothing of the Nobel peace prize, which he covets as the one priceless bauble that has so far eluded him. Such is the power of a US president that, once he decided to use it, the pieces swiftly fell into place.\n\nDoes that, then, make Donald Trump the hero of this hour? Those of us who have opposed him with such vehemence this past decade should swallow hard and give credit where it is due. His willingness to bully and twist arms, his command of global attention, his force of personality were all deployed, on this occasion, towards a noble goal: to stop the killing and to free the hostages.\n\nBut any admiration has to be qualified by a single, hard fact. Trump could have done this so much earlier. When he returned to the White House on 20 January, a ceasefire deal not too different from this one was in place. When Netanyahu moved to break that ceasefire in March, Trump could have slammed his foot down then and said no. Instead, he gave him a green light - and what followed was, in many ways, the worst six months of the war. Trump had the power to stop it - and he chose not to.\n\nOf course, this same critique applies in spades to Netanyahu himself. Indeed, the offence is worse because a deal broadly similar to the one he agreed this week was on offer as early as June 2024. But he refused it, and others like it that followed, deciding at each turn that his personal and political interests were best served by ongoing war. True, Joe Biden deserves blame for not using US power to demand a halt (though his situation was harder than his successor's, if only because Donald Trump does not have a Donald Trump in the wings, seemingly promising Netanyahu better terms). But Netanyahu's culpability runs deep.\n\nEven if you only go back to the opportunity forsaken in March, just think of all that was lost. The Palestinian lives destroyed in Gaza since then; the hunger as Israel shut off aid. And from Israel's own point of view: the hostages forced to endure seven months more in captivity; the soldiers killed in action; the demolition of Israel's standing, especially over aid, turning the country into a global pariah. \"It's really a catastrophe,\" says Milstein, \"because it seems we made a very long voyage only to find ourselves once again at exactly the same point.\" You can pass a similarly damning judgment on Hamas: it could have ended Gaza's agony so much earlier by releasing all the hostages.\n\nAs it turns out, Trump did not get his Nobel - not this year, at any rate. If he really wants it, it's clear what he has to do. He has to stay as engaged over the coming months and years as he has been these past 10 days. Every one of his plan's 20 points contains enough unresolved tensions to bring the entire thing crashing down.\n\nAbove all, he has to stay on Netanyahu's case, alert to the danger that Netanyahu will bank what has been agreed and never move on to what is meant to come next. Note the Netanyahu ally who starkly declared: \"There's no phase two.\" Trump cannot tolerate that. He has to maintain the pressure, preventing Netanyahu from playing any of his usual games. If Trump really wants the prize of peace, there is no other way.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-2.578385170059975,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Michael Milstein\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Israeli military intelligence\",\n    \"role\": \"Former Colonel in Israeli Military Intelligence; Foremost Analyst of Hamas\",\n    \"nationality\": \"ISR\",\n    \"quote\": \"Let's face it, Hamas didn't really change anything dramatically in its basic positions.\",\n    \"message\": \"Hamas did not significantly alter its fundamental stances regarding the ceasefire negotiations.\"\n  crema\",\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Donald Trump\",\n    \"organisation\": \"United States Government\",\n    \"role\": \"President\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"Israel cannot fight the world.\",\n    \"message\": \"Israel cannot effectively oppose the global community on significant international issues.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Michael Milstein\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Israeli military intelligence\",\n    \"role\": \"Former Colonel in Israeli Military Intelligence; Foremost Analyst of Hamas\",\n    \"nationality\": \"ISR\",\n    \"quote\": \"It's really a catastrophe because it seems we made a very long voyage only to find ourselves once again at exactly the same point.\",\n    \"message\": \"The current situation is a disaster because despite extensive efforts and a long period of time, the conflict has returned to its original problematic state.\"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP"}],"createTime":"2025-10-15T10:36:59.811740Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"S3nvaNzFMe24nvgP7_XLwQE","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":297,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":297}],"promptTokenCount":2018,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":2018}],"thoughtsTokenCount":2202,"totalTokenCount":4517,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}}}

Apart from people rushing to work or walking their dogs, the place seemed relatively deserted. Even some of the most popular coffee spots had more vacant seats than occupied ones. This day feels like a holy day - not because it actually is one (it's Simchat Torah Eve) - but because of the return of the last 20 living hostages from Hamas captivity. There was no need to ask where everyone was. Thousands had gathered in \"Hostages Square\" in Tel Aviv (formerly known as Museum Square - and who knows if that name will ever return). Others were glued to their television screens at home, as if it were the World Cup final. Thinking about it, the war's final act trumps even that. Apparently, the sound of silence can be full of joy.\n\nEver since the deal was struck and the war finally came to an end, it seems Israel has been under the influence of the best drug imaginable. Strolling through the streets now, you see people smiling for no reason - or perhaps for the best reason of all. Even the serious faces worn by TV anchors have been replaced by cheerful ones. \"Today is the day I smile,\" said one correspondent gladly this morning, stating the obvious. But as the TV presenters and panellists persisted with the good news theme, you could not help but notice the other footage. As the buses and Red Cross vehicles drove through the Gaza Strip on their mission to bring the hostages back, the scene was one of destruction - ruins of cities where people once lived.\n\nThe fight for the hostages and the calamity in Gaza are two sides of the war's coin. That will remain the case in the days to come. But as time goes on, more and more focus will probably shift to Gaza, its rehabilitation, and the truth that lies beneath all the rubble.\n\nThe curtain-raiser will come later today in the resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt, where the leaders' summit on Gaza will convene. Perhaps this meeting, and those that will inevitably follow (given that the plan for \"the day after\" could hardly be resolved in a single day) will set a timeline for a new international governing body and security force to actually take control of the Gaza Strip. As if there were any doubt about the urgency of this, even by the weekend some news reports suggested that Hamas had already reasserted control of Gaza as part of its own version of \"law and order\".\n\nOnly at noon today, almost in the final minute of stoppage time, did Egypt announce that Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, had also been invited to the summit. Given that Netanyahu had been reluctant to end the war ever since it began - no matter the cost - this decision seemed to be an attempt to tie him to the \"day after\" scenario for both Israel and Gaza. Unlike the first phase, which brought the hostages home, the second offers Israel no tangible gains. It's all about Gaza's rehabilitation. Considering that many Israelis viewed the end of the war as a price worth paying to bring the hostages back, one must wonder: will they seek a return to the battlefield once all Israelis are safely home? Netanyahu's attendance in Sharm el-Sheikh, alongside Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian National Authority, should have provided an answer to that question. However, just an hour later - after the Israeli media celebrated his imminent attendance - his office stated that he had to politely decline due to the proximity to the start of the holy day in Israel.\n\nWhatever Netanyahu's true reason may be, perhaps the bottom line remains: this summit, coordinated by Donald Trump with world leaders, is a way of signalling to Israel that Gaza is no longer under its sole authority. The war is over - as Trump keeps saying - and now others will take charge. Of course, any initiative in Gaza will still need to work closely with the Israeli government. But the question remains whether it will be a cooperative effort or a matter of direct orders - much like the way Trump compelled Israel to accept the deal to end the war.\n\nSpeaking in the Israeli parliament today, Trump said: \"Israel, with our help, has won all that they can by force of arms - you've won. Now it is time to translate these victories against terrorists on the battlefield into the ultimate prize of peace and prosperity for the entire Middle East.\" This statement may come as no surprise, given his previous remarks declaring that \"the war is over\". It also aligns with the scheduled visit to Israel by the president of Indonesia tomorrow: Israel doesn't have diplomatic relations with Indonesia, and the visit might suggest another \"peace deal\" is coming. But (not to spoil the celebrations), one must ask: where do the Palestinians fit into this vision? Is an independent state really just around the corner? Does that include the West Bank, and does it mean the end of all settlements? That seems a premature conclusion, to say the least. And if that is not forthcoming, is lasting peace really likely?\n\nBut that is just one unresolved issue among many. Others were evident during the early celebrations on Saturday evening in Hostages Square, where, behind the displays of happiness and relief, deeper truths emerged. The most notable moment of the evening came when Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, attempted to praise Netanyahu for his role in achieving the deal. The crowd - far more familiar with his failures - booed loudly. Not once, not twice. Every time his name was mentioned, the crowd jeered. The rhythmic chant, \"Thank you, Trump\" only emphasised whom Israelis view as their true saviour.\n\nThis may be the most important revelation: in the eyes of the public, Israel's government - or at least the one representing its interests - sits not in Jerusalem, but in Washington. But even if that's true for now, Trump - as he's proven countless times before - is like a child who quickly tires of old toys. At some point, he will probably abandon the Middle East and redirect his attention elsewhere: the Russia-Ukraine conflict (after all, there's still time to chase next year's Nobel prize), his battle against immigration, or the war he's declared on US democracy itself.

It could be the US. It could be Greta Thunberg.\n\nOver the past month, Thiel has hosted a series of four lectures on the downtown waterfront of San Francisco philosophizing about who the antichrist could be and warning that Armageddon is coming. Thiel, who describes himself as a \"small-o Orthodox Christian\", believes the harbinger of the end of the world could already be in our midst and that things such as international agencies, environmentalism and guardrails on technology could quicken its rise. It is a remarkable discursion that reveals the preoccupations of one of the most influential people in Silicon Valley and the US.\n\n\"A basic definition of the antichrist: some people think of it as a type of very bad person. Sometimes it's used more generally as a spiritual descriptor of the forces of evil,\" Thiel said, kicking off his first lecture. \"What I will focus on is the most common and most dramatic interpretation of antichrist: an evil king or tyrant or anti-messiah who appears in the end times.\"\n\nThiel was on the forefront of conservative politics long before the rest of Silicon Valley took a rightward turn with Donald Trump's second term as president. He's had close ties to Trump for nearly a decade, is credited with catapulting JD Vance into the office of vice-president, and is bankrolling Republicans' 2026 midterm campaigns. Making his early fortune as a co-founder of PayPal, he has personally contributed to Facebook as its first outside investor, as well as to SpaceX, OpenAI and more through his investment firm, Founders Fund. Palantir, which he co-founded, has won government contracts worth billions to create software for the Pentagon, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) and the National Health Service in the UK. Now, with more attention and political pull than ever, the billionaire is looking to spread his message about the antichrist, though he is better known for his savvy politics and investments than his contributions to theology.\n\n\"I'm a libertarian, or a classical liberal, who deviates in one minor detail, where I'm worried about the antichrist,\" Thiel said during his third lecture.\n\nThiel's talks, which began on 15 September and ended on Monday, were long and sweeping, mingling biblical passages, recent history and philosophy and sometimes deviating into conspiracy theories. He peppered them with references to video games and TV shows along with musings on JRR Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. He likewise recalled conversations with Elon Musk and Benjamin Netanyahu and spoke at length about how he thinks Bill Gates is \"a very, very awful person\".\n\nTickets for the series went for $200, selling out within hours. Attendees were told that the lectures were strictly off the record and that they were forbidden from taking photos, videos or audio recordings. At least one person who took notes and published them had his ticket revoked by a post on X.\n\nGuardian reporters did not attend the lectures or agree to the off-the-record stipulation. Recordings were provided by an attendee who gave them on the condition of anonymity.\n\nWhen reached for comment, Thiel spokesperson Jeremiah Hall did not dispute the veracity of the material given to the Guardian. Hall did correct a piece of the Guardian's transcription and clarified an argument made by Thiel about Jews and the antichrist.\n\nThe Silicon Valley heavyweight drew on a wide swath of religious thinkers, including the French-American theorist René Girard, whom Thiel knew at Stanford University, and the Nazi jurist Carl Schmitt, whose work he said helped create the core of his own beliefs. He credited the English Catholic theologian John Henry Newman as the inspiration for his four-part series, saying: \"Newman did four, so I'm doing four. I'm happy about it.\"\n\nThe venture capitalist has hosted and attended events and lectured on the topic for decades, going back to the 1990s, according to a report by Wired. In recent months, he has spoken to theologians and podcasters about the antichrist both publicly and in private. His beliefs are diffuse, meandering and often confusing, but one tenet he's steadfastly maintained over the years is that the unification of the world under one global state is essentially identical to the antichrist. In his talks, he uses the term \"antichrist\" almost interchangeably with \"one-world state\".\n\n\"One world or not, in a sense is the same as the question antichrist or Armageddon. So in one sense, it's completely the same question,\" he said.\n\nHis version of history, and its potential end, posits technology as a central driver of societal change and takes a Christianity-focused, Eurocentric view that declines to engage much with other religious movements or parts of the world.\n\nOn the day of Thiel's final lecture in San Francisco, as the mostly young and mostly male crowd lined up to get in, a group of about 20 protesters stood out front holding anti-Palantir and anti-Ice signs that said things such as \"Predatory tech\", \"We do not profit from people who profit from misery\" and \"Not today Satan\".\n\nA trio of self-described \"satanists\" dressed in black costumes with goth makeup walked up and down the line of attendees carrying a goblet of red liquid with a small plastic replica of a bone. \"Will you bring our dark lord Peter Thiel this baby's blood?\" they asked. Then they performed what they called a \"dark ritual\", dancing slowly in a circle to Mozart's Requiem in D minor, which ended with them writhing on the city sidewalk, and yelling: \"Take us to your personal hell ... Thank you for being our dark lord.\"\n\nThe Guardian is publishing substantial quoted passages alongside contextual annotations so that the public may be informed on what an influential figure in politics and technology was saying behind closed doors.\n\nHe believes the Armageddon will be ushered in by an antichrist-type figure who cultivates a fear of existential threats such as climate change, AI, and nuclear war to amass inordinate power. The idea is this figure will convince people to do everything they can to avoid something like a third world war, including accepting a one-world order charged with protecting everyone from the apocalypse that implements a complete restriction of technological progress. In his mind, this is already happening. Thiel said that international financial bodies, which make it more difficult for people to shelter their wealth in tax havens, are one sign the antichrist may be amassing power and hastening Armageddon, saying: \"It's become quite difficult to hide one's money.\"\n\nIt's because the antichrist talks about Armageddon nonstop. We're all scared to death that we're sleepwalking into Armageddon. And then because we know world war three will be an unjust war, that pushes us. We're going hard towards peace at any price.\n\nWhat I worry about in that sort of situation is you don't think too hard about the details of the peace and it becomes much more likely that you get an unjust peace. This is, by the way, the slogan of the antichrist: 1 Thessalonians 5:3. It's peace and safety, sort of the unjust peace.\n\nLet me conclude on this choice of antichrist or Armageddon. And again, in some ways the stagnation and the existential risks are complementary, not contradictory. The existential risk pushes us towards stagnation and distracts us from it.\n\nThiel rarely gives a definitive answer about who exactly the antichrist might be or how Armageddon might come about - a central point across his lectures is that nothing is written in stone or inevitable - but he does give the contours of what a global conflict that could lead to Armageddon might look like.\n\nThere's all sorts of different ways, one world or none, antichrist or Armageddon, that I'm tempted to think about this, and here's one sort of application. In terms of how does one think about the current geopolitical moment. How does one think about the nature of the conflict between the United States and China, the west and China. You don't really know how it's going to go. You can ask, are we heading for world war three or cold war two? And if you sort of reflect on the history of the two world wars and the first cold war. But first, if there ever was an unjust war, world war one is an unjust war. If there ever was a just war, world war two was probably a just war, with certain caveats. World war one is really insane. World war two was about as justified as a war can be. I think we can say that if you had an all out world war three or war between nuclear powers involving nuclear weapons, it would simply be an unjust war. A total catastrophe, possibly literal Armageddon, the end of the world. So world war three will be an unjust war. But then if you have a cold war, you have to distinguish between - can you have a just peace and an unjust peace?\n\nSomehow, it's very strange how the first cold war from '49 to '89 ended. But it ended with roughly what I think of as a just peace, where somehow you didn't have a nuclear war. And somehow our side, which I think was more the good side, basically won. And you ended up not with a perfect peace, but more or less a just peace. And so if we have world war three, it will be an unjust war. If we have cold war two, maybe it can end in a just peace or an unjust peace. Reflecting on this material and thinking about it, it's obviously not written in stone and there's a lot of different ways this stuff can go. But I keep thinking that, if you had to put odds on it, aren't the odds that we're trending towards the fourth quadrant this time. The fourth possibility that cold war two will end an unjust peace.\n\nThiel devotes a large section of his second lecture to a quote from the Book of Daniel that involves a prophecy about the end times, which he equates to modern advances in technology and globalization.\n\nLet's go on to 'many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased.' It means science progressing, technology improving, globalization, people traveling around the world. Of course in some sense, I think these things ... I'm not sure they're completely inevitable, but there is some direction to it. Where there's a linear progression of knowledge and something like globalization that happens. But of course, the details matter a lot. Knowledge increasing, science progressing, technology improving can be a very good thing. No disease, death, protect people from natural disasters. Then, of course, we can destroy ourselves with nuclear weapons, bioweapons, etc. And similarly, globalization is ... you have trade in goods and services. There's certain ways to escape from tyrannical governments. And of course there is danger in the one-world state of the antichrist.\n\nAs the antichrist is synonymous with a one-world state for Thiel, he also believes that international bodies including the United Nations and the international criminal court (ICC) hasten the coming of Armageddon. Throughout his lectures, he warns of what he sees as the danger of these bodies and the harms they've already caused. In the following quotes, he's lamenting the actions of the ICC:\n\nThey've started arresting more and more people. Rodrigo Duterte, the former president of the Philippines, was arrested this year. They had arrest warrants out for Netanyahu and Gallant.\n\nWhen I met Netanyahu early in 2024, about a year and a half ago, we talked about what he's doing in Gaza, and the one-liner he had was: 'I can't just Dresdenize Gaza - you can't just firebomb them.' So it's like, come on, 'I'm less of a war criminal than Winston Churchill. Why am I in so much trouble?'\n\nDuring a Q&A portion of one of the lectures, an attendee asked specifically about Thiel's thoughts on abolishing the ICC, saying: \"If we get rid of the ICC or other organizations that exist to bring, in theory, justice, how can we right crimes? Should we not have prosecuted Nazi criminals?\" Thiel responded:\n\nI think there was certainly a lot of different perspectives on what should be done with the Nuremberg trials. It was sort of the US that pushed for the Nuremberg trials. The Soviet Union just wanted to have show trials. I think Churchill just wanted summary executions of 50,000 top Nazis without a trial. And I don't like the Soviet approach, but I wonder if the Churchill one would have actually been healthier than the American one.\n\nThiel believes that the antichrist would be a single evil tyrant. He mentions several figures he believes are particularly dangerous and, while he never definitively says who the antichrist is, he makes suggestions about how some people could be antichrist-type figures.\n\nA basic definition of the antichrist. Some people think of it as a type of very bad person. Sometimes it's used more generally as a spiritual descriptor of the forces of evil. What I will focus on is the most common and most dramatic interpretation of antichrist: an evil king or tyrant or anti-messiah who appears in the end times.\n\nSpecifically, he suggests the antichrist would be a \"luddite who wants to stop all science\", referencing Thunberg, Eliezer Yudkowsky, and Marc Andreessen.\n\nMy thesis is that in the 17th, 18th century, the antichrist would have been a Dr Strangelove, a scientist who did all this sort of evil crazy science. In the 21st century, the antichrist is a luddite who wants to stop all science. It's someone like Greta or Eliezer.\n\nIt's not Andreessen, by the way. I think Andreessen is not the antichrist. Because you know, the antichrist is popular. I'm trying to say some good things about Andreessen here, come on.\n\nDuring a question and answer session, Thiel was asked to respond to a quote from fellow investor Andreessen - a name he audibly bristled at. He said Andreessen is engaged in hyperbole and \"gobbledygook propaganda\" when it comes to the promises of AI.\n\nWhere should I start? I'm tempted to be triggered in some nasty ad hominem argument, but I can't resist so I'll do that. I don't know, this is just pure Silicon Valley gobbledygook propaganda. I wouldn't give someone who said things like that too much money to invest.\n\nLater, he returns to these \"legionnaires of the antichrist\".\n\nIn late modernity, where science has become scary and apocalyptic, and the legionnaires of the antichrist like Eliezer Yudkowsky, Nick Bostrom, and Greta Thunberg argue for world government to stop science, the antichrist has somehow become anti-science.\n\nGates, the philanthropist and co-founder of Microsoft, is high on the list of people Thiel does not like.\n\nOne of my friends was telling me that I should not pass up on the opportunity to tell those people in San Francisco that Bill Gates is the antichrist. I will concede that he is certainly a Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde-type character. The public Mr Rogers, the neighborhood character. I saw the Mr Hyde version about a year ago, where it was just a nonstop, Tourette's, yelling swear words, almost incomprehensible what was going on.\n\nUltimately, Thiel concedes Gates cannot be the antichrist, bringing up the topic more than once:\n\nHe's not a political leader, he's not broadly popular, and again, perhaps to Gates's credit, he's still stuck in the 18th century alongside people like Richard Dawkins who believe that science and atheism are compatible.\n\nI don't think even someone like Bill Gates, who I think is a very, very awful person, is remotely able to be the antichrist.\n\nPope Benedict XVI is someone who Thiel admired because he was one of the few popes who referenced the possibility of an antichrist:\n\nThe TL; DR: my belief is that Benedict literally thought that the historic falling away from the church during his papacy was a sign of the end times.\n\nHowever, Thiel said Benedict failed at spreading the message of the antichrist because he \"was not very courageous\".\n\nI often like to say libertarianism and marijuana are both gateway drugs to alt-right, other ideas. The danger of the red pill is you move on the black pill. And somehow Benedict overdosed on red pills.\n\nMusk, a longtime friend and ally of Thiel, came up during one of the lectures in the context of the Giving Pledge, a pact Gates founded in 2010 where billionaires pledged to donate the majority of their money to philanthropy. Here is Thiel recapping the conversation:\n\nIf I had to pick a little bit on Elon - and I'm going to pick on him because I think of him as one of the smarter, more thoughtful people ...\n\nThis is a conversation I had with him a few months ago, and it was like: 'I want you to unsign that silly Giving Pledge you signed back in 2012, where you promised to give away half your money. You have, like, $400bn. Yes, you gave $200m to Mr Trump, but $200bn - if you're not careful - is going to leftwing non-profits that will be chosen by Bill Gates.'\n\nAnd then I - one step ahead - rethought it and said: 'You don't think about this much because you don't expect to die anytime soon, but you're 54 years old. I looked up the actuarial tables: at 54, you have a 0.7% chance of dying in the next year. And 0.7% of $200bn is $1.4bn - about seven times what you gave to Trump. So Mr Gates is effectively expecting $1.4bn from you in the next year.'\n\nAnd to his credit, Elon was, well, pretty fluid on it. He said: 'Actually, I think the odds of me dying are higher than 70 basis points.' A shocking explosion of self-awareness. Then: 'What am I supposed to do - give it to my children? I certainly can't give it to my trans daughter; that would be bad. You know, it would be much worse to give it to Bill Gates.'\n\nWhen asked about slain far-right commentator Charlie Kirk's memorial in reference to the role of Christianity in American politics, Thiel initially demurred saying it was \"above his pay grade\". When further prompted, he described what he saw as two versions of Christianity on display at the event:\n\nI think, um - what to say - I was thinking about, you know, I had the chart: the katechon pagan Christianity versus the eschaton - the Christianity of Constantine versus that of Mother Teresa. We had an illustration of that with Kirk's wife saying that she forgave the murderers because that's what Christ would do. This was an incredibly saintly form of Christianity. And then, you know, President Trump - I don't know, I forget the language exactly - but, you know, Charlie was into forgiving, being nice to his enemies. He doesn't believe in being nice to his enemies; he wants to hurt his enemies. And that's sort of the pagan Christian view. And the problem - the naive view - is: there has to be something somewhere in between, right? But how do you concretize that? What's the thing that's in between Mother Teresa and Constantine - between forgiving the murderer and delighting in punishing your enemies?\n\nPerhaps, I don't know, perhaps the in-between thing I thought was that maybe Trump and Elon were able to forgive each other.\n\nThiel argues that, in order for the antichrist to be able to pull off the Armageddon in one lifetime, they need to be young today - he points to 33 as an auspicious number. In these quotes, he draws parallels to powerful figures who died at the age of 33, including Jesus, Buddha and some literary characters:\n\nChrist only lived to age 33 and became history's greatest man. The antichrist has to somehow outdo this. I don't want to be way too literal on the 33 number - I'd rather stress the antichrist will be a youthful conqueror; maybe in our gerontocracy, 66 is the new 33. But something like these numbers do occur almost mystically through a number of different contexts.\n\nBuddha begins his travels at age 30 and experiences Nirvana, ego death, at age 33. But I had to be ecumenical and say something nice about Islam. One idea that's pretty cool is, when you're reborn into your afterlife, you're born into your 33-year-old self. Your 33-year-old self is your best self. Libby's - the Roman historian's 33rd chapter of the 33rd book - it announces this 33-year-old conqueror. It's like Alexander at the peak of his power. Or even in Tolkien, the hobbits have a coming-of-age ceremony at 33. That's how old Frodo is when he inherits the ring.\n\nBy the same token, people who are older cannot be Thiel's antichrist. Here Thiel gives some examples:\n\nTrajan, a Roman emperor, wept when he reached the Persian Gulf in AD115 at the age of 65. He's too old to beat Alexander the Great's achievements in India. He died two years later. Hitler is 50 by the time world war two starts - he mimetically loses to Napoleon, who's only 30 when he became first consul of the French Republic. That goes on to the same problem for a seventysomething Xi Jinping. Racist, sexist, nationalist, maybe the second coming of Hitler. But not even the second coming of Genghis Khan. Past the sell-by date.\n\nHe frequently oscillates between talking about the antichrist and the katechon - a term very briefly used in the Bible that refers to something holding back the coming of the antichrist. In one example, he describes a post-cold war shift to embracing neoliberalism and bureaucracy as an example of antichrist-like government.\n\nOf course, you have all these examples where it's one toggle switch from katechon to the antichristic thing. Claudius to Nero, Charlemagne to Napoleon, anti-communism after the Berlin Wall comes down, it gets replaced by neoliberalism. Which is, you know, the Bush 41 new world order, which you can think of as anti-communism where there's no communists left. Or Christian democracy, which is sort of the European form of the katechontic, transnational anti-communism. Once the communists are gone, it sort of decays into the Brussels bureaucracy. All kinds of different riffs one could do with this. Or to go even further, if something is not powerful enough to potentially become the antichrist, it probably isn't that good as a katechon.\n\nIn his last lecture, Thiel also responds during the Q&A portion to a question about potential 2028 presidential candidates and whether they are antichrist or katechon. When asked about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Thiel says that he worries about there being a \"woke American pope\"- Pope Leo XIV - and a \"woke American president\", creating a \"Caesar-Papist fusion\". He goes on to talk about Ocasio-Cortez in relation to Thunberg:\n\nOne of the ways these things always get reported is, I denounce Greta as an antichrist. And I want to be very clear: Greta is, I mean she's maybe sort of a type or a shadow of an antichrist of a sort that would be tempting. But I don't want to flatter her too much. So with Greta, you shouldn't take her as the antichrist for sure. With AOC, you can choose whether or not you want to believe this disclaimer that I just gave.\n\nThiel is asked several times about Trump and how he fits into his imagination of what form Armageddon might take. In one instance, he is asked whether Trump's opposition to global governance makes Thiel feel any relief about the hastening of a one-world order.\n\nAt the very best, you shouldn't have even the most fanatical Trump supporter. You know, no politician, not even Reagan, will solve all problems for all time. Maybe we both were sort of delusional about Reagan in the 80s. There was some moment in the 1980s when we thought that Reagan had permanently solved the deepest problems in the world for all time. And that's too high a bar. That was too high a bar for Reagan. That's an unfairly high bar you're giving to Mr Trump. You're just trying to make a subtle anti-Trump argument and I'm not going to let you do that.\n\nOne of Thiel's longstanding political affiliations has been anti-communism, and in his fourth lecture, he suggests that opposition to communism following world war two is something that held back the antichrist. At other times, he is critical of post-cold war presidents and government order.\n\nI always sort of wonder what functions as the katechon in the world after 1945. This is Schmitt's 1947 diary. 'I believe in the katechons, for me the only possible way to understand Christian history and find it meaningful. The katechon needs to named for every epoch for the past 1948 years.' The way I interpret this is that sotto voce, Schmitt is saying he has no idea what the katechon is. And maybe, the New Dealers are running the whole planet. Then of course, 1949 the Soviets get the bomb, and my sort of provisional answer is that the katechon for 40 years, from '49 to '89, is anti-communism. Which is in some ways is somewhat violent, not purely Christian but very, very powerful.\n\nI've argued that the katechon, or something like this, is necessary but not sufficient. And I want to finish by stressing where one goes wrong with it. If we forget its essential role, which is to restrain the antichrist, the antichrist might even present himself or itself or herself as the katechon, or hijack the katechon. This is almost a memetic version. A similarity between the antichrist and the katechon, they're both sort of political figures. The katechon is tied in with empire and politics. If the antichrist is going to take over the world, you need something very powerful to stop it.\n\nThiel also opines on modern-day Russia and offers his views on Vladimir Putin:\n\nIn some sense, there are perhaps two candidates for the successors to Rome. For all sorts of reasons, I don't particularly like the Russian theories of all these ways where you have Putin describing himself as the katechon and the last Christian leader in the world. It's hard to look into someone's heart. I always suspect he's more of a KGB agent than a Christian. And then, of course, to be a katechon, you have to be strong enough to possibly become the antichrist. And Russia is not nearly powerful enough to take over the world. It cannot simply be the katechon or the new Rome.\n\nThiel also comments on the relation between Jewish people and the antichrist. He argued against medieval theologians' idea that the antichrist would be Jewish.\n\nThere's probably a lot I can say about the relation of the Jews to the antichrist. The philo-semitic rebuttal, just to get it on the table, is that the Jews in the Bible are described as a stubborn and stiff-necked people. Which is mostly a bug, but maybe in the end times, it is a feature because - this is sort of the way [Vladimir] Solovyov phrased it - that they're too stubborn to accept Christ, they will be too stubborn to be charmed by the antichrist. And so, they become the center of resistance to the antichrist in the Solovyov narrative.\n\nIn response, Thiel's spokesperson said: \"Peter was arguing against medieval, anti-Semtic theologians who suggested that the Antichrist will be Jewish,\" citing Solovyov.\n\nThiel's final lecture dedicates a large portion of its time to talking about empires and what role the US government plays in holding back or advancing the antichrist. He is characteristically noncommittal, describing the country as having characteristics of a one-world government and also being outside it:\n\nNow this is not meant to be an anti-British or anti-American lecture. It's just that America is, at this point, the natural candidate for katechon and antichrist, ground zero of the one-world state, ground zero of the resistance to the one-world state. The US world police is the one truly sovereign country. They always say the president is the mayor of the US and the dictator of the world. International law gets defined by the US. That's sort of Nato's prime, to see in some ways, coordination of the world's intelligence agencies.\n\nThen of course, the global financial architecture we discussed is not really run by shadowy international organizations, it's basically American. And perhaps always a very important feature is the reserve current status of the dollar, where it's sort of the backstop for all the money. The petrodollar regime, there's sort of crazy ways you have trade deficits, current account deficits, but then in all these ways, the money gets recycled into the US.\n\nThen of course, there's sort of a way where from a certain perspective, the US is also the place that's the most outside the world state. In many ways, it's probably one of the best tax havens, at least if you're not a US citizen. And then there are all these ways the US is a kind of ideological superpower. Christian, ultra-Christian, anti-Christian sense, woke Protestant liberation theology, social gospel, social justice. City on a hill, this institution serves as a beacon of light for other nations and honor.\n\nAt another point in his final lecture, he seems to suggest that when things are codified or formalized they tend to lose their power or ability to operate. He selects Guantánamo Bay detention camp as an example:\n\nBy 2005 in Guantánamo, you were way better off as a Muslim terrorist in Guantánamo, the liberal lawyers had taken it over by 2005, than as a suspected cop killer in Manhattan. In Manhattan if you were a suspected cop killer back in 2005, you know, there was some informal process they had for dealing with you. Guantánamo, it was formalized. Initially, they did some bad things and then very quickly, they weren't able to do anything, any more. And this is again a sort of revelatory unraveling process.\n\nDuring the Q&A section, Peter Robinson talks about John Henry Newman's description of the antichrist promising people things like civil liberty and equality. \"He offers you baits to tempt you,\" Robinson said, quoting Newman. Then, Robinson says to Thiel: \"The antichrist is a really cool, glamorous hip operator. Is that Zohran Mamdani?\" Thiel doesn't directly answer the question, but does offer his take on the young, progressive mayoral candidate:\n\nI don't think Mamdani can be president because he's not a natural-born citizen. So he's capped out at mayor. I also don't think he's really promised to reduce my taxes.\n\nIn his final lecture, Thiel was asked to comment on various potential 2028 presidential candidates and whether they'd be more of an antichrist figure or a katechon.\n\nThiel says he is \"very pro-JD Vance\". But he has some concerns about his allegiance to the pope.\n\n\"The place that I would worry about is that he's too close to the pope. And so we have all these reports of fights between him and the pope. I hope there are a lot more. It's the Caesar-Papist fusion that I always worry about. By the way, I've given him this feedback over time. And you know with the sort of ... I don't like his popeism, but there's sort of a way if I steel manned it. It's always, you have to think about whether if you say you're doing something good, whether it's a command, a standard or a limit, or whether in philosophical language, is it necessary or sufficient. And so when JD Vance said that he was praying for Pope Francis's health, it's as a command, as a necessary thing. OK, that's ... if you're a lot more if you're a good Catholic. But what I hope it really means is that it's sufficient, and that he's setting a good example for conservative Catholics like you, Peter, who listen to the pope too much. And perhaps all you have to do to be a really good Catholic is pray for the pope. You don't really need to listen to him on anything else. And if that's what JD Vance is doing, that's really good. I'm worried about the Caesar-Papist fusion.\n\nThiel also spoke about San Francisco and his views on Gavin Newsom, the California governor.\n\nI would say that if we go to the katechontic thing and the US is that, tech and politics are radically separate, Silicon Valley is really, really separate from DC in an extreme way. If these things could be fused, the say someone like that perhaps represents a way to do that. That's the part where, if there was a way to ... you know, he was the governor of California, he was the mayor of San Francisco. In a way, San Francisco is more important than California. The world city is more important than just this sort of silly province called California. And if you could fuse Washington and San Francisco, that's a very dangerous thing. It's kind of, it's sort of in a way the last president where such a fusion of sorts happened. I think it was FDR with New York and DC. So that's the piece that would be tricky.\n\nAnd you know, by the way, these things have been very, very unfused historically. Back in 2008, one of my liberal friends was trying to get 75 tech-type people to endorse Obama and they got like 68, 69 and thought maybe they could get me. I told them, man, if there are only six or seven, you want to be in the minority. It's more valuable to be one of the seven than one of the 68. And then his counterpoint was, well, you know, we need to all get on board with Obama because he's going to win and then we'll have an influence. And then, the really crazy ... and then in a way, Obama ... if you think about the primary in 2008, the Democratic primary, Obama had the students, the minorities, the young people. Hillary was the finance world in New York, the unions. Hollywood was sort of split 50/50 between Obama and Hillary.\n\nBut Silicon Valley was the one sector of the economy that went all in for Obama. But it didn't work at all. And then if you fast forward to the Obama cabinet, there were zero people from Silicon Valley. There was no representation at all. And so, even Obama was very far from anything resembling a fusion. And then the question is whether Newsom will be like that or different.\n\nChief among Thiel's concerns about how quickly the world is hurtling toward an Armageddon is what he describes as a stagnation or slowing down of technological and scientific progress. He attributes part of that to the use of science and technology - once largely seen as a force for good, in his telling - for harm.\n\nThe creation of the gun and the machine gun \"wounded our faith in science and tech\", he said. \"And then the atom bomb somehow blew it up entirely. And in some sense in 1945, science and tech became apocalyptic. It left us with a question.\" This fear of tech is what the antichrist will seize on to gain power, he says.\n\nDuring the Q&A portion of the first lecture, Thiel is asked about how artificial intelligence (AI) - the much-hyped darling of his fellow Silicon Valley investors - fits into this larger narrative of technological stagnation. Thiel said AI is a symptom of the larger tech stagnation and that people including Andreessen need to boost its promises because there's nothing else going on.\n\nIf we're going to not have this sort of crazed corporate utopianism versus effective altruist luddism, luddite thing. If you try to have some more nuanced version of this, you try to quantify it. How big is the AI revolution? How much is it going to add to GDP? Add to living standards? Things like that. My placeholder is, it's looking probably on roughly the scale of the internet from 1990 to the late 90s. Maybe it can add 1% a year to GDP. There are big error bars around that. And I think the internet was quite significant. People talked about the internet in very similar terms in 1999. That's another way where it sounds like roughly the right scale.\n\nThe place where it's very different, where it feels both true of the internet and maybe it's true of AI, maybe a place where I would agree with Andreessen. The negative part of the statement is: 'But for AI, nothing else is going on.' He's not talking about going to Mars, so it doesn't sound like he believes Elon's about to go to Mars. I think there's a negative part, if AI was not happening, wow, we are really stuck. Things are really stagnant. And maybe that's why people have to be so excited about this one specific vector of technological progress. Because outside of that, to a first approximation, things are totally, totally stagnant. Maybe even the internet has run out of steam but for AI. So that's another framing. Now, the thing that strikes me is very different from '99, if I had to give a difference, again I'm too anchored and rooted in the late 90s. But the late 90s, it was broadly optimistic. And there were a lot of people who thought about it just like Andreessen does. Nobody feels that personally. You can't start a dot-com company from your basement in Sacramento. You can't start an AI company, you have to do it in San Francisco. You have to do it in Silicon Valley. It has to be at an enormous scale. Most things aren't big enough. And then there are layers and layers and layers where it feels incredibly non-inclusive. Maybe people just updated from the internet because maybe the internet turned out to have a lot of winner-take-all dynamics.\n\nIn one of the lectures, Thiel plays a video of a 60 Minutes segment about a German law that cracks down on online hate speech. He's trying to show an example of where tech regulation goes too far - hence giving power to the antichrist:\n\nThis kind of video is ridiculous but, of course, indicative of this larger trend. There is this crazy judge in Brazil who is arresting everybody. Australia has more or less ended internet anonymity with age verification required for all social media. The UK is arresting 30 people a day for offensive speech. I'm sort of always in favor of maximal free speech, but my one concrete test is whether I can talk about the antichrist. If I can't, that's too restrictive.\n\nIn his fourth lecture, he also suggests that his beliefs about the end of the world informed his own work in tech at companies such as PayPal:\n\nI was working at PayPal at the time trying to build the technology to evade these policies of the world's powers and principalities. So it was natural to think about the antichrist in the context of the world of financial architecture. I'll still defend PayPal as more good than bad.\n\nThiel peppered his lectures with references to pop culture, calling out YouTube influencers like MrBeast and throwing out terms like \"libtard\" - a rightwing slur for people with progressive political views. Sometimes these references pertained to the antichrist; at other times, Thiel was just giving his views on politics, modern society and Silicon Valley, like here:\n\nThe Succession TV show about the Murdochs is unthinkably retro in Silicon Valley. Only a 20th-century media company could be handed off to someone's children. If you think about the tech companies, I don't know, would anybody name a company after themselves? The last tech person who did this was, I think, Dell in the mid-1980s. This is like if you're a retro Republican from Texas. It is so unthinkable to do this.\n\nIn his second lecture, Thiel also explores the idea of the antichrist through four works of literature - Francis Bacon's New Atlantis, Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels, Alan Moore's Watchmen graphic novel and Eiichiro Oda's manga series One Piece. Thiel states that identifying the antichrist is possibly \"hard to do in the present and always sort of controversial\", but that \"you at least identify the antichrist in literature\".\n\nHe describes the plot of Watchmen, a 1986 graphic novel involving superheroes grappling with moral questions about humanity against the backdrop of impending nuclear war:\n\nThe antihero Ozymandias, the antichrist-type figure, is sort of an early-modern person. He believes this will be a timeless and eternal solution - eternal world peace. Moore is sort of a late-modern. In early modernity, you have ideal solutions, 'perfect' solutions to calculus. In late modernity, things are sort of probabilistic. And at some point, he asks Dr Manhattan whether the world government is going to last. And he says that 'nothing lasts forever.' So you embrace the antichrist and it still doesn't work.\n\nThiel later finds biblical meaning in the manga One Piece, discussing how he believes it represents a future where an antichrist-like one-world government has repressed science. He believes that the hero, Monkey D Luffy, represents a Christlike figure.\n\nIn One Piece, you are set in a fantasy world, again sort of an alternate earth, but it's 800 years into the reign of this one-world state. Which, as the story unfolds, gradually gets darker and darker. You sort of realize, in my interpretation, who runs the world and it's something like the antichrist. There's Luffy, a pirate who wears a red straw hat, sort of like Christ's crown of thorns. And then towards the end of the story, transforms into a figure who resembles Christ in Revelation.\n\nThiel, along with a researcher and writer at Thiel Capital, explored these ideas at greater length in an essay for the religious journal First Things earlier this month.\n\nIn a word, no.

But a long-term solution remains distant\n\nDonald Trump called the pause in hostilities he has brokered the first step to a \"strong, durable and everlasting peace\". No one can do more to determine the outcome than the US president. This was, for him, a modest statement, acknowledging that Israel and Hamas had agreed to the first phase of his plan - it being their decision, not his, to break a multi-point agreement into a multi-stage discussion. Two parties so far apart agreed on one thing: both would rather defer the really difficult issues.\n\nIn Israel and Gaza, there was joy - however tentative - at the announcement. An end to the annihilation, the release of all hostages and the resumption of large-scale aid have all been desperately needed. There is every reason to fear that this will not lead to a lasting peace, and every reason to strive to ensure that it does. In finally reining in Benjamin Netanyahu, and in offering Qatar a security guarantee that persuaded it (with Egypt and Turkey) to lean more heavily upon Hamas, Mr Trump has created an opportunity which must be seized.\n\nTo recognise that his intercession has brought this ceasefire is also to acknowledge that Mr Trump, and Mr Biden before him, could have ended this conflict long ago. More than three dozen of the hostages taken by Hamas-led militants on 7 October 2023 are believed to have been killed in captivity. More than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli military in Gaza. The tens of thousands of children who have been orphaned or are suffering acute malnutrition offer some indication of how profound and lasting the damage will be.\n\nThe Hamas atrocities of 7 October, and the genocide in Gaza, have pushed both Israelis and Palestinians towards seeing the underlying conflict as, more than ever, an existential struggle. Hostilities could easily resume - though for now, at least, both Hamas and the Israeli government seem to believe that a deal will be better for them than continuing the conflict.\n\nHamas has no desire to disarm. The bulk of Mr Trump's plan says that Israel will not occupy or annex Gaza, but offers Palestinians in essence a colonial administration under Mr Trump and Sir Tony Blair, with only the wispiest suggestion that they might prove themselves deserving of statehood in the future. Mr Netanyahu has already rejected that.\n\nIsrael's prisoner release will not include the highly popular Marwan Barghouti, jailed for ordering murders in the second intifada and seen by many as the figure most capable of bringing Palestinian factions together. Mr Trump may not remain invested in this crisis for long once he has taken his victory lap. Strikingly, the breakthrough came shortly before the Nobel peace prize is to be announced, on Friday (though the committee held its last meeting on Monday).\n\nEmmanuel Macron, whose diplomatic initiatives helped pave the way for this moment, stressed on Thursday that it should lead to a political outcome based on the two-state solution. The growing international pressure upon Israel, itself a reflection of public opinion's impact upon the governments of its allies, and the increased involvement of the region, were critical. The temptation for Israel's allies now may be to ease off, acting as if this short-term fix were a solution. They must instead invest intensified effort to produce the strong and durable peace of which Mr Trump spoke - which will only be feasible if it is founded on justice.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-6.018042931189904,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Donald Trump\",\n    \"organisation\": \"United States Government\",\n    \"role\": \"President of the United States\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"strong, durable and everlasting peace\",\n    \"message\": \"The pause in hostilities represents the initial stage toward achieving a robust, lasting, and perpetual peace.\"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP"}],"createTime":"2025-10-15T10:36:59.812751Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"S3nvaM_NMYC4nvgPk77D6Ak","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":91,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":91}],"promptTokenCount":1105,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1105}],"thoughtsTokenCount":2108,"totalTokenCount":3304,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}}}

It calls for Gaza's deradicalization but not an end to Israel's messianism. It micromanages the future of Palestinian governance while saying nothing about the future of Israel's occupation.\n\nIt is riddled with ambiguities, devoid of timetables, arbiters or consequences for inevitable eventual violations. If all goes according to plan - if the deal's vagueness is not exploited to torpedo it; unavoidable clashes over subsequent phases do not get in the way of the first stage; Arab and Muslim states maintain pressure on the United States and the United States gets Israel to comply - life for Gazans will transition from utter hell to mere nightmare. Their condition will shift from defenceless prey to twice-dispossessed refugees in their own land. And still, it would be a momentous achievement.\n\nIsrael seldom has enjoyed such unrivalled regional military dominance and has never been more isolated. The Palestinians have rarely benefited from such widespread support, and their national movement hardly ever been more adrift. Neither side managed to convert the tremendous assets they accumulated into tangible political gains.\n\nIt took an American president unbound by traditional domestic constraints, immune to laws of political gravity, willing to break with convention, engage with Hamas and tackle Israel, to get this done and provide the parties with what they could accept. For Israel, the return of hostages, a continued military presence in Gaza, and the end of a war that was sapping domestic resources and draining global support. For Hamas, a halt to the brutal slaughter, an influx of humanitarian aid, release of prisoners, ruling out deporting Gazans and annexing the West Bank, and a de facto recognition of the movement as chief Palestinian interlocutor on matters of war and peace.\n\nFor both, this was validation for an imperfect deal. Little of the plan's provisions mattered beyond those. As it has in the past, progress in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict depended less on textual details, about which Trump knew nothing, or on intellectual contortions, which he disdains, than on the exercise of raw power - which he relishes. That this ought to have happened long ago, that so many lives could and should have been spared, is beyond dispute. It is a burden those responsible must bear and for which they ought to be held accountable.\n\nThen there is the involvement of Turkey and Qatar, states that Hamas trusts and upon which it depends. They could get the Islamist movement to agree to what it previously had rejected and accept guarantees it earlier discarded. This was not a deal between Israel and Hamas. It was a deal among US president Trump, Turkey president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and Qatar emir Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani. The United States provided guarantees to Israel, and Turkey and Qatar provided guarantees to Hamas.\n\nWhere direct American assurances to Hamas that the war would not resume after the hostages were released proved lacking, indirect assurances through Ankara and Doha did the trick because Hamas views Washington as less likely to betray states about whom Trump cares a lot than an armed movement about which he cares very little. Israel basked in having vanquished an Iranian axis of resistance. It inherited a Turkish/Qatari axis of Islamists instead.\n\nA striking feature of the landscape has been the utter absence, the invisibility, of the recognized Palestinian leadership. These were talks about the Palestinians' future with no official Palestinian representative in the room. Like a bystander pleading for a role in a play written and staged by others, the Palestinian Authority offered a running commentary on the horrors of a war in which it did not fight and then applause for a deal with which it had nothing to do. Unable to rule the West Bank, it volunteers to govern Gaza. What greater proof of irrelevance than having to beg for relevance.\n\nIsrael set out to break the Palestinians' will, to crush their resolve. Instead, out of memories of atrocities, mass killings, and widespread destruction, more radical elements may sprout, seeking vengeance and resorting to desperate acts. Images of 1948 helped summon the Palestine Liberation Organization; the realities of these past two years could give rise to more lethal outcomes. It may take some time, but to listen to Palestinians in general, and to Gazans in particular, is to sense an ominous inevitability: that history is gearing up for revenge. Tomorrow may indeed be yesterday.\n\nTrump's unorthodoxy helped create this fragile truce. Greater heterodoxy will be required for a sturdier answer to the matter of Gaza, greater still for a path to peaceful coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians. Adroit plans or clever language will not help. Each of the confrontations between Israel and Hamas - in 2009, 2012, 2014 and 2021 - spawned intricate blueprints to open crossings, ease restrictions, begin reconstruction and stop arms smuggling. Not one was implemented. The same holds for innumerable proposals for a two-state solution that, since at least 2000, skillfully resolved issues of territorial allocation, the division of Jerusalem, and security arrangements, but consistently failed to resolve the conflict. If the problem were purely technical, Americans would have an impressive record of success, not a desultory catalogue of failures, for no one can top their semantic ingenuity. Elaborate plans will not yield progress. Wielding power, playing politics, and understanding and shaping the sensitivities of both sides may.\n\nAn unorthodox approach would eschew the quick fixes of the past that fixed nothing: those that obsessed about technical solutions; banked on more \"sensible\" Israelis and more \"moderate\" Palestinians who enjoyed little domestic sway; focused on bilateral engagements between parties whose uneven power guaranteed failure; excluded influential third parties; and clung to rigid notions of partition that failed to address deeper grievances and aspirations. This has been tried in vain for more than three decades. The futile pursuit of those illusions and deceits brought us to where we are.\n\nThis conflict is not a technical dispute over territory, boundaries or security arrangements. It is a deep, abiding, emotional, struggle between two peoples. It serves no purpose to pretend otherwise. The pretence may make some feel better. It will not improve the lives of a single Israeli or Palestinian. No good has come from misinterpreting reality. Some good may come from facing it.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-21.258480072021484,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP"}],"createTime":"2025-10-15T10:36:59.759607Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"S3nvaLeuLqednvgP2KWkqQ8","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":6,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":6}],"promptTokenCount":1728,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1728}],"thoughtsTokenCount":362,"totalTokenCount":2096,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}}}

Erling Haaland stole the attention with a hat-trick on it, rendering his early double penalty miss a distant memory, and the upshot was that Norway could look with clear heads toward a near-certain first World Cup appearance in 27 years. A win over Estonia next month will confirm their presence; Egil Olsen, their manager at France 1998, looked on as Israel offered scant opposition to Europe's most ruthless attacking force.\n\nIsrael's very presence in Oslo had been highly contested, the buildup framed by the Norwegian Football Federation's public stance that they should be banned from international football due to the war in Gaza. There will be relief that confrontations were kept to a minimum beyond a brief spate of trouble outside the Ullevaal Stadion during half-time.\n\nEarlier, phase one of the day's intensive security operation had concluded smoothly. At 2pm a crowd of pro-Palestine protesters, cohered by the Palestine Committee in Norway, had gathered at Spikersuppa in the centre of Oslo in preparation for their march to Ullevaal. A matter of yards away, polite applause had rippled intermittently as the swearing-in of Norway's parliament was relayed on a big screen. The marchers, whose number swelled to around 1,500 during the 2.6 mile route, were more vigorously propelled by flares and beating drums. Red cards were distributed among attendees.\n\nInger Lise, wearing a national team scarf, was one of the few who had turned up to the protest in Norway's football colours. Once a keen player, she had a ticket for the game but considered the occasion tainted. \"It's very frustrating,\" she said while holding one end of a large \"Free Palestine\" banner, the other clasped by a friend. \"The game shouldn't have been played but it's not up to us to ruin it. It's just horrible that we are here now.\"\n\nInside Andy's Pub, a Liverpool-themed bar situated close to the march's meeting point, six supporters in their mid-50s felt the moment they could make an impact had passed. \"Israel should have been banned before, we can't do anything now,\" one said. They had travelled from Tromso, inside the Arctic Circle to watch the match and wore shirts carrying names from the 1998 squad.\n\nAs the march passed northwards through well-heeled neighbourhoods, some residents gathered on balconies or wound down car windows to shout encouragement. The police presence, visible but never overbearing, stopped well short of any confrontation at that point. The only exception came as its participants prepared to set off. A handful of Israeli journalists had arrived at the protest and, apparently after being involved in an exchange with a member of the public, were escorted away from the scene.\n\nThe 80-minute march ended with speeches and songs at a stage constructed opposite Ullevaal, a smaller protest arriving to swell numbers in the hour before kick-off. Nearby, a small group of fans bearing both Norwegian and Israeli flags were marshalled towards the ground by police officers.\n\nAs the teams emerged before kick-off, supporters in the west stand unfurled a Palestine flag next to another imploring \"Let children live\". The stance Fifa and Uefa take to those displays remains to be seen. Israel's pocket of around 100 visitors held up their own flag during the national anthem while a minority of home supporters whistled.\n\nThat was as heated as matters inside the stadium became. The only notable security lapse arose in the eighth minute when, even though the front three rows were covered in a bid to prevent this eventuality, a sole protester ran on to the pitch before being wrestled to the ground by security personnel. He was named by local media as Mario Ferri, who refers to himself as \"The Falcon\" and has a history of such incursions in various global stadiums.\n\nBy then Haaland had already erred from the spot, Daniel Peretz saving his first effort and a VAR-ordered retake. After play resumed Norway pulled well clear against opponents whose technical acuity was let down by a nonexistent defence. Haaland made amends quickly either side of own goals by Anan Khalaili and Idan Nachmias, the latter when the ball was drilled against him by Peretz. Three goals in a 10-minute spell had ended the contest.\n\nAs the first half ended, around 200 protesters remained outside. In the day's one major flashpoint, police used teargas after a barrier was pulled down close to the stadium entrance. Ten arrests were made but the authorities emphasised that most those involved had otherwise behaved well.\n\nHaaland put himself front and centre again by finishing twice more, his third goal bringing up 51 in 46 caps. \"Free Palestine\" chanted a section of the support as proceedings wound down, reminding everyone else that the backdrop could never quite be punctured.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-3.3096506219161186,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Inger Lise\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"NOR\",\n    \"quote\": \"It's very frustrating.

Police blamed staff churn for the errors in a lengthy written response to the justice and communities committee this month after questioning at the NSW parliamentary inquiry into antisemitism.\n\nOperation Shelter was formed to target antisemitism on 11 October 2023 in the wake of a pro-Palestine protest at the Sydney Opera House. As of August, police had laid 249 charges against 231 individuals, 44 of which related to offences involving physical violence.\n\nMany of the incidents recorded in the Operation Shelter database met the police definition of antisemitism: \"Prejudice or hatred directed at individuals based on their Jewish faith or cultural identity\". But a review of all the 367 incidents recorded as antisemitic showed many were not antisemitism, police told the parliamentary inquiry.\n\n\"In some cases, incidents were incorrectly categorised as 'antisemitic' solely on the basis that the person reporting or the victim was Jewish,\" the response read.\n\nOne incident involved a man allegedly insulting a Jewish community member with public pro-Palestine views and striking him on the shoulder. Another involved a man verbally abusing pro-Palestinian protesters sitting outside Anthony Albanese's office and destroying their banners.\n\nA person who displayed a Palestinian flag on their home reported receiving a handwritten letter with \"inflammatory\" language and a doll's head taped to it, and another person reported anti-Palestinian graffiti targeting Muslims and Arabs written on toilet doors at Hornsby Westfield. Police mistakenly classified both incidents as antisemitic.\n\nAnti-Israel posters and pro-Palestinian protests and graffiti were among the incidents recorded, as was a sighting of a Lime bike graffitied with the words \"Free Gaza\" outside a Jewish daycare.\n\nA controversial alleged attempt by News Corp staff to provoke antisemitic comments from workers at a Middle Eastern restaurant was reported by those workers, but nonetheless recorded on the police spreadsheet as antisemitism.\n\nThe review also found 38 duplicate entries, with one protest at a dock in Port Botany in March 2024 entered 17 times, and another protest at Unanderra in April 2024 entered four times.\n\nThe varying levels of consistency and accuracy in the list - a manually recorded spreadsheet of \"Shelter-related\" incidents drawn from a police computer database - was the result of frequent rotation of officers managing Operation Shelter, police said.\n\nThe NSW police minister, Yasmin Catley, has previously defended controversial hate speech bills passed by state parliament in February by citing figures suggesting there had been more than 700 antisemitic incidents since October 2023.\n\nThe new laws, described by one Labor MP as \"draconian\", gave police broad powers to restrict protests near places of worship and criminalised people making racist remarks in public, after a spate of antisemitic attacks over the summer.\n\nCatley in September conceded she \"may have had the figure wrong\" after police clarified that just 367 of the 815 incidents recorded by Operation Shelter up to 26 March 2025 were antisemitic.\n\n\"If I did, I apologise to the committee, but quite frankly, there would be so many more incidents than have been reported,\" she said at the time.\n\nThe written response provided by police to parliament this month show the true number of recorded antisemitic incidents to be even lower.\n\nPolice previously told the inquiry in July that incidents' inclusion in hate crime databases were largely driven by individuals' or communities' feelings or decisions to make complaints.\n\n\"We're not recording it to determine that it is a hate incident,\" Jennifer Hastings, a policy officer, told the inquiry.\n\n\"If the community feels that it is an incident, then we will capture it.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the NSW government said: \"Over the last two years there has been an outbreak of antisemitism.

In 2013, she joined the opinion staff at the Wall Street Journal. In 2017, she joined Brett Stephens in moving to the New York Times' opinion desk, where she started writing her own column.\n\nWhat did she do at the New York Times?\n\nAs a journalist at the New York Times, Weiss developed a reputation for both criticizing Donald Trump in his first term and cracking down on the left's cancel culture, from cultural appropriation to protests on college campuses.\n\nIn the swirls of the #MeToo movement, she penned a viral op-ed defending comedian Aziz Ansari, who was accused of sexual misconduct in an anonymous essay. Weiss said at the time that the essay \"transforms what ought to be a movement for women's empowerment into an emblem for female helplessness\".\n\nWhy did Weiss leave the Times?\n\nWeiss' departure from the Times increased her profile even more. In July 2020, she published a public resignation letter, addressed to Times publisher AG Schulzberger, where she accused the company of becoming partisan, and reporting stories \"to satisfy the narrowest of audiences\".\n\nShe also said she was \"the subject of constant bullying by colleagues who disagree with my views\". The Times said at the time it was committed to \"fostering an environment of honest, searching and empathetic dialogue\" between its employees.\n\nWhat is the Free Press?\n\nMonths after her departure from the Times, Weiss started a newsletter called Common Sense. The newsletter eventually expanded into a media startup, the Free Press, which publishes newsletters and podcasts. The company received backing from investors including venture capitalists Marc Andreesen and David Sacks and former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz.\n\nAt the Free Press, Weiss published controversial reports and series, including the podcast The Witch Trials of JK Rowling, about the Harry Potter author and her clash with liberals over her views on trans people, and a report on the Columbia pro-Palestine encampments with the headline \"Camping Out at Columbia's Communist Coachella\".\n\nThe author of a book titled How to Fight Anti-Semitism, Weiss is a longtime, staunch supporter of Israel and has utilized the Free Press to defend the country during the war in Gaza.\n\nWhy is Paramount Skydance acquiring the Free Press?\n\nSkydance Media made an agreement with the Trump administration that its content will promote a \"diversity of viewpoints\" in the company's bid to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to merge with Paramount Global.\n\nThe FCC agreed to the merger in July, which saw Skydance pay $8bn to merge with Paramount, making Ellison in charge of the new Paramount Skydance company.\n\nAhead of the merger, Paramount Global also paid $16m to Trump to settle a defamation lawsuit the president had filed against 60 Minutes, a move that was largely criticized by media watchdogs. Paramount also announced the 2026 cancellation of Stephen Colbert's show, which was widely seen as a capitulation to Trump.\n\nBrendan Carr, chairman of the Federal Communications Commissions, which greenlit the merger, said that he was \"pleased\" with commitments the company made to reform CBS. In a letter to Carr, Skydance said it would ensure that the new company's \"array of news and entertainment programming embodies a diversity of viewpoints across the political and ideological spectrum\".\n\nParamount Skydance is also reportedly preparing to make a bid to buy Warning Bros Discovery, the company that owns CNN.\n\nOn Monday, Ellison suggested the acquisition of the Free Press - and Weiss' appointment as editor-in-chief - would help CBS News to reach \"the majority of the country\".</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.8382883899616744,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Bari Weiss\",\n    \"organisation\": \"The New York Times\",\n    \"role\": \"Journalist\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"transforms what ought to be a movement for women's empowerment into an emblem for female helplessness\",\n    \"message\": \"This movement transforms what should be a movement for women's empowerment into a symbol for female helplessness.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Bari Weiss\",\n    \"organisation\": \"The New York Times\",\n    \"role\": \"Former Opinion Writer\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"the subject of constant bullying by colleagues who disagree with my views\",\n    \"message\": \"I was the subject of constant bullying by colleagues at The New York Times who disagreed with my views.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"The New York Times\",\n    \"organisation\": \"The New York Times\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"fostering an environment of honest, searching and empathetic dialogue\",\n    \"message\": \"We are committed to fostering an environment of honest, searching, and empathetic dialogue among our employees.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Brendan Carr\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Federal Communications Commission\",\n    \"role\": \"Chairman\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"pleased\",\n    \"message\": \"As Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, I am pleased with the commitments Skydance Media made to reform CBS News.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Skydance Media\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Skydance Media\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"array of news and entertainment programming embodies a diversity of viewpoints across the political and ideological spectrum\",\n    \"message\": \"Our new company's array of news and entertainment programming will embody a diversity of viewpoints across the political and ideological spectrum.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"David Ellison\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Paramount Skydance\",\n    \"role\": \"Head of Paramount Skydance\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"the majority of the country\",\n    \"message\": \"The acquisition of The Free Press and the appointment of Bari Weiss as editor-in-chief will help CBS News to reach the majority of the country.\"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP"}],"createTime":"2025-10-15T10:36:59.782270Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"S3nvaL7fL76dnvgPx--U6A8","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":530,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":530}],"promptTokenCount":1346,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1346}],"thoughtsTokenCount":3023,"totalTokenCount":4899,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}}}

Few expect Macron to return from Egypt with a solution to the deepening domestic political crisis he presides over, however. Fewer still have enough trust in a government so subservient to Macron that it can survive the forthcoming deliberations of the National Assembly.\n\nBecause this is no conventional parliamentary crisis, but a crise de régime. Inspired by Charles de Gaulle's vision of executive pre-eminence vested in a quasi-monarchic presidential ascendancy, the governing system established by the Fifth Republic in 1958 no longer functions. Challenged by a hung parliament, a severe fiscal crisis and a volatile international environment, the French state is paralysed.\n\nAt the heart of the problem lie the nature of the presidential office and the current incumbent's politics. Defeated in the June 2024 European elections, Macron dissolved parliament and called snap elections, recklessly risking the ignominy of the far right, then riding an unprecedented wave of support in the polls, gaining power.\n\nAgainst all expectations, a hastily assembled leftwing coalition and a campaign of tactical voting thwarted Marine Le Pen's National Rally. But no political group achieved enough seats in the fragmented electoral landscape that emerged from the election, to govern alone. Yet Macron defied democratic logic and parliamentary arithmetic. He rebuffed the centre-left's claim that it had earned the right to attempt to form a government. Instead, he successively appointed conservative and centrist prime ministers to head up minority administrations, incapable of resolving a fiendishly complex political equation.\n\nIt is hard to imagine how Lecornu, a close ally of Macron, can succeed in passing a national budget where his two immediate predecessors, Michel Barnier and Francois Bayrou, failed, and new legislative elections seem inevitable. Calls for the president's own resignation have grown louder and are no longer confined to the radical fringes. Two of his former prime ministers joined the chorus last week. An early presidential election is nonetheless unlikely. Macron is under no obligation to vacate the Elysée before his term ends in 2027, and has vowed to see it out.\n\nSooner or later, however, he will have to return to the electorate, which may well reinforce the far-right National Rally but still elect another hung parliament. The regime, whose stability is predicated on the principled respect of the popular will and on the existence of a clear majority, was never designed to facilitate - and even disincentivises - the emergence of governing coalitions common in the rest of Europe. The Fifth Republic may well have entered its terminal phase. Like the Macronist project, it started crumbling as soon as he was inaugurated.\n\nRemarkable though it was, Macron's 2017 victory is best understood as the collective failure of a political generation that had come of age in the late 1970s. Led by Nicolas Sarkozy on the right and François Hollande on the left, this cohort had none of the historical experience and little of the intellectual heft of De Gaulle or François Mitterand. In an age of financial globalisation and socioeconomic dislocation, they proved unable to articulate an adequate response to the concerns of voters. Hollande's presidential term was especially challenging, defined by the eurozone debt crisis and an unprecedented wave of terror attacks.\n\nHollande left the country in mourning and a republic in doubt about its values and mission. Politically debilitated, he did not stand for a second term, leaving the Socialists to field a weak candidate and the left divided. Sarkozy's heirs meanwhile chose another corrupt politician to be their champion and watched his campaign subsequently collapse. In a political landscape further destabilised by populisms of all hues, Macron, then just 39, saw and smartly exploited an opening. He allowed great swathes of a disaffected public opinion to project their desires on to his relatively blank slate. As most voters chose to vote against the traditional mainstream parties on the right and left, his candidacy emerged as the untested receptacle for various political frustrations. In the runoff, Le Pen proved unequal to his talents, and Macron prevailed.\n\nSoon a character that many hoped would be transformative proved to be just another young man with old-fashioned ideas. Within weeks, he embraced the trappings of the office and set about governing the country in a top-down, micromanagerial manner maladapted to a restive and anxious country. His supply-side, trickle-down economics allowed rent-seekers to prosper at the expense of the wider economy.\n\nConstitutionally insulated from political pressures, Macron became the divisive creature of France's presidential regime. Few democratic systems appear so designed to turn legitimate political ambitions into narcissistic personality disorders. From the gilets jaunes (\"yellow vests\") crisis onwards, as the regime proved unable to address public concerns, Macron consistently belittled innovative representative mechanisms and civil society organisations. In 2022, the invasion of Ukraine and a divided opposition allowed him again to reduce the election to a set of negative choices. Another runoff against Le Pen helped him rally those voters primarily concerned for democracy.\n\nMacron himself now focuses the nation's hostility. He may well take his government, and the dysfunctional regime, down with him.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-9.488098780314127,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP"}],"createTime":"2025-10-15T10:36:59.769924Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"S3nvaIT_LoC4nvgPk77D6Ak","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":6,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":6}],"promptTokenCount":1529,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1529}],"thoughtsTokenCount":219,"totalTokenCount":1754,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}}}

His consultancy has echoed much of this zeal through a stream of policy papers arguing that artificial intelligence should be put at the heart of government.\n\nHowever, critics are concerned that Blair, who is known to be close to Keir Starmer's government, has been able to set the agenda without enough public scrutiny. There have also been questions over the reliance of Blair's consultancy on donations from the Silicon Valley billionaire Larry Ellison, a friend of Donald Trump and Elon Musk.\n\nEllison, who this year briefly became the world's richest person, has donated or promised more than $300m to Blair's consultancy.\n\nThe documents released to the Guardian under freedom of information legislation show how the 12 diners discussed the government's evolving policies on artificial intelligence at what was described a \"salon dinner\".\n\nHosted at the end of January in the five-star Corinthia hotel, the diners included Lonne Jaffe, the managing director of the US venture capital firm Insight Partners, which invests in technology companies.\n\nAlso present were Alex Kendall, the chief executive of Wayve, which is seeking to develop self-driving cars; Nigel Toon, the head of Graphcore, which produces computer chips; and Marc Warner, the chief executive of Faculty AI, which published a joint document last year with TBI on how AI could be used to improve public services.\n\nA spokesperson for Clegg, who as president for global affairs at Meta jointly hosted the dinner, said :\"During his time at Meta Nick Clegg regularly met with government ministers and leaders from other tech companies. As the executive responsible for policy and global affairs that was literally his job.\"\n\nA TBI spokesperson said: \"This event was a discussion about a range of issues between tech leaders with a minister in attendance. No company paid to attend.\"\n\nThe companies represented at the dinner said they had not donated money to TBI, nor hired it.\n\nThe dinner illustrates how Blair's consultancy works to push his pro-technology agenda. Having rapidly expanded, TBI is active in 45 countries with its staff numbering more than 900. Its latest accounts show its income totalled $145m in 2022 from a mixture of fees for its advice and donations. The identities of many of its donors and clients are kept secret.\n\nThe consultancy has drawn criticism that its policy positions have been shaped by its donors' commercial interests - an accusation it has denied. It was also criticised for continuing to take money from Saudi Arabia after the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. Blair is in line to play a leading role in the reconstruction of postwar Gaza.\n\nWeeks before the dinner, the government had given TBI a confidential summary of its action plan for artificial intelligence days before it was due to be published. On 9 January, Feryal Clark, then a minister in the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT), spoke to Jakob Mokander, TBI's science policy director, at her instigation.\n\nThe next day, an aide to Clark emailed Mokander to say: \"It was great talking to you yesterday. As a follow-up please see this confidential summary of the action plan. Thank you for agreeing to amplify publication of the plan on Monday through your network and supportive quotes.\" Mokander replied: \"Thank you for sharing the action plan (confidentiality noted).\" Blair backed the action plan, aimed at expanding the country's role in developing and deploying artificial intelligence, when it was published on 13 January.\n\nAsked why it had given early sight of this document to TBI, a spokesperson for the DSIT said: \"We make no apologies for regularly engaging with stakeholders. It is standard practice to share embargoed information with them ahead of announcements.\"\n\nThe TBI spokesperson said: \"It is standard practice for governments to consult experts and engage a wide range of stakeholders when shaping policy. The AI opportunities action plan rightly drew on our published work, as the footnotes make clear.\"</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.35464894062763935,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Nick Clegg's spokesperson\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Meta\",\n    \"role\": \"Spokesperson\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"During his time at Meta Nick Clegg regularly met with government ministers and leaders from other tech companies.

And October is only half way through. Yesterday, quite rightly, all the focus of the political world was on Tel Aviv and Sharm El-Sheikh as all the living hostages were released from their underground hell in Gaza to rapturous scenes of joy in Israel.\n\nIt was a momentous and historic day - albeit one that proved Sir Keir Starmer and Britain have become little more than a bit part player on the global stage.\n\nBut for the Conservatives it was a familiar scene. Another opportunity to confirm that not many people care what they have to say, and still fewer care what they think.\n\nThe Conservative and Unionist Party was born in 1912 when the older Conservative Party merged with the Liberal Unionist Party to form one of the biggest and most influential political movements in the world.\n\nBut it is not an exaggeration to say that it is currently at possibly the lowest point in its entire history. When former Tory culture secretary Nadine Dorries defected to Reform in September, she declared the Conservative Party dead.\n\nDanny Kruger, former chief speech-writer to David Cameron and political secretary to prime minister Boris Johnson, was next to move to Reform; he was perhaps a bigger fish to catch for Nigel Farage and a more damaging loss to the Tories.\n\nKruger said his former party was \"rightly and naturally punished for its record\" and for \"failing to control our borders\". The Tories, he argued, got it wrong on mass migration and reducing taxes..\n\nPeople are asking how long can it be before the likes of Robert Jenrick - accused of being a racist last week for telling the truth about a visit to Handsworth - jump ship.\n\nLast week Reform was leading the Conservatives by 14 points in the polls by 31 points to 17 - and that was after a slight bounce for Kemi Badenoch during the party conference.\n\nThe truth is that the writing looks to be on the wall for the Tories. While Labour flounders around the 19 mark in the latest polls, The party that produced Winston Churchill seems incapable of capitalising on government scandals, errors and downright lies.\n\nTake this week. When shadow home secretary Chris Philp appeared on my show he spoke of flat out lies told by Bridget Phillipson on TV over Jonathan Powell's involvement in the collapse of the Chinese spy trial. He said it was inconceivable that the Government's national security adviser had no role in the scandal. It remains to be seen, though, whether he can land a punch on the gaffe-prone Cabinet.\n\nOne day earlier Conservative Party chairman Kevin Hollinrake championed an Opinium poll in a Sunday newspaper in which 33 percent of people thought Badenoch had made a good conference speech. It would seem that a win for the Tories in 2025 doesn't have to hit a particularly high note.\n\nTheir conference in Manchester was a dismal affair. Journalists attending it used words like \"depressing\" and said it lacked atmosphere and dynamism. By contrast the Reform shindig in Birmingham was a positively non-political event with a focus on ordinary people who expressed a genuine desire for a change of direction for Britain.\n\nMany of the 260,000 members of Reform are Tory voters who will never vote for the Conservative Party again. That message comes through loud and clear on every Talk show that I do from our listeners and viewers.\n\nAnd yet, Tory MPs and some former spin doctors seem convinced that the party can recover. Most shadow ministers will tell me quite gleefully that the voters will come back. That their new ideas are proving popular on the doorsteps of the nation.\n\nNothing could be further from the truth. The Conservatives suffered a landslide defeat in July last year ending up with just 121 seats from an original majority of 80 in the last Parliament; it looks like they will suffer an even worse rout at the hands of Reform in the local elections next May.\n\nBut still they seem fixated on the ways of old. Margaret Thatcher's ghost seems to haunt them still - they even exhibited some of her outfits in Manchester, where they had to draw a curtain across half of the exhibition hall to make it look more crowded.\n\nWhen shadow chancellor Mel Stride made one of the big set piece speeches about the dour state of Rachel Reeves' economy, there were so many empty seats it looked like an unpopular fringe event with no free wine.\n\nEven the resurrection of Boris Johnson for a book tour recently didn't interest those voters who used to love him but now regard him as a failure and a traitor to the cause.\n\nAnd with every week that passes more and more former government ministers attempt to prove that the mistakes under Boris, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss were nothing to do with them.\n\nIf delusion was a currency they could cash in for victory, there might be some hope for the modern Conservative Party. It's time for people who care about it to start administering life support before it's too late.\n\nMike Graham presents Morning Glory every weekday from 6am-10am on Talk</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-3.795235025223775,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Danny Kruger\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Reform UK\",\n    \"role\": \"Member\",\n    \"nationality\": \"GBR\",\n    \"quote\": \"rightly and naturally punished for its record and for failing to control our borders\",\n    \"message\": \"The Conservative Party was rightly and naturally punished for its past actions and for its failure to control the nation's borders.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Chris Philp\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Conservative Party\",\n    \"role\": \"Shadow Home Secretary\",\n    \"nationality\": \"GBR\",\n    \"quote\": \"it was inconceivable that the Government's national security adviser had no role in the scandal\",\n    \"message\": \"It is inconceivable that the Government's national security adviser had no role in the scandal involving the collapse of the Chinese spy trial.\"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP"}],"createTime":"2025-10-15T10:36:59.817210Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"S3nvaLrwMb6dnvgPx--U6A8","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":199,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":199}],"promptTokenCount":1473,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1473}],"thoughtsTokenCount":3525,"totalTokenCount":5197,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}}}

The sentiment was quickly seized upon by Trump's critics, who saw it as a not-too-subtle dig at the US president's use of the military in American cities and pressure on his political enemies at home.\n\n\"When authoritarians seize power, it is crucial to recognise courageous defenders of freedom who rise and resist,\" the committee wrote. \"Democracy depends on people who refuse to stay silent, who dare to step forward despite grave risk, and who remind us that freedom must never be taken for granted, but must always be defended - with words, with courage and with determination.\"\n\nChristopher Sabatini, a senior fellow for Latin America at the Chatham House thinktank, suspected Trump would be \"peeved\" by the decision.\n\n\"He had lobbied shamelessly for this peace prize, even exaggerating his contribution to peace globally. He has mobilized significant [military] resources at great political cost to him, quite frankly, off the coast of Venezuela. And then the thing he most coveted gets snatched away from him by the person he is supposedly defending. I can't see how this will sit well for a person who wears personal grievance on his sleeve.\"\n\nSabatini believed Nicolás Maduro's administration would be angry about Machado's award. \"[But] it may even be - given Donald Trump's likely personal reaction to this - that it could even play a little bit to their advantage.\"</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.39930027767247006,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Steven Cheung\",\n    \"organisation\": \"The White House\",\n    \"role\": \"Director of Communications\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"The Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace.\",\n    \"message\": \"The Norwegian Nobel Committee's decision to award the Nobel peace prize demonstrated that it prioritizes political considerations over the pursuit of peace.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Steven Cheung\",\n    \"organisation\": \"The White House\",\n    \"role\": \"Director of Communications\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"Trump will continue making peace deals, ending wars, and saving lives.

Live footage of their release and their family reunions was broadcast on large screens around the square. The plaza has been the centre of the national campaign for their release since 250 Israelis were abducted on 7 October 2023 in the surprise Hamas attack on southern Israeli communities which killed 1,200 people and ignited the conflict.\n\nOver the course of Monday, a large crowd massed in the southern Gazan city of Khan Younis to celebrate the return of nearly 1,700 Palestinians detained over the course of the war, while in the West Bank capital of Ramallah people welcomed the arrival of 88 Palestinian detainees who had been serving life sentences imposed by Israeli courts. At least one had been imprisoned for 24 years. About 160 more were deported through Egypt after their release.\n\nThe ceasefire appeared to be holding in Gaza on Monday after a two-year Israeli military onslaught that has killed nearly 68,000 people. But 2.1 million surviving Palestinians there still face a deep and complex humanitarian crisis in a sealed coastal strip where the overwhelming majority of homes have been destroyed or severely damaged, and which has been starved of humanitarian supplies for many months.\n\nTom Fletcher, the head of the UN's humanitarian relief branch OCHA, said aid deliveries had begun arriving in Gaza, with far more poised to enter the stricken territory in the coming days.\n\n\"Millions of Palestinians counting on lifesaving aid getting through at scale. We must make it happen,\" Fletcher said on social media while attending the peace summit at Sharm el-Sheikh.\n\nDonald Trump, who brokered the ceasefire last week, arrived in the Red Sea resort after a short visit to Israel. He declared \"a new day is rising\" and signed a joint declaration with the leaders of Egypt, Qatar and Turkey, intended to turn the ceasefire into a coherent peace plan.\n\nThe last Gaza ceasefire broke down after two months in March when Israel resumed its offensive. There are fears in the region that this truce may also prove precarious, especially given the resistance from the far-right wing of the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition.\n\nTrump insisted that his 20-point proposal for maintaining peace and rebuilding Gaza would take root. \"The document sets out a whole series of rules and regulations and is very comprehensive,\" the US president said.\n\nThe contents of the declaration signed in Sharm el-Sheikh were not immediately made public and the aspirations expressed in Trump's 20 points, involving the disarming of Hamas and the deployment of a stabilisation force under a technocratic Palestinian committee overseen by a \"peace board\" chaired by the US president, present an extremely challenging task.\n\nThe \"Summit for Peace\" was a virtual who's who of Middle Eastern and European politics, while attracting other unlikely power brokers in the Trump era of international diplomacy such as the president of Fifa, Gianni Infantino. Leaders from at least 27 countries, many in Europe and the Middle East, joined the summit in Sharm el-Sheikh on Monday.\n\nConspicuously absent among them was Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu, whose attendance other regional leaders would probably have protested. But the leaders of the major Arab and regional states, including Egypt's Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Turkey's Recep Erdoğan, and the leaders of the Gulf states Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, were present. Keir Starmer and European leaders from France, Germany, Italy, Hungary and others also attended.\n\nHowever, representatives from Israel or Hamas were absent from the signing ceremony. A last minute plan by Trump to invite Netanyahu was scuppered after Erdoğan said he would not land his plane if the Israeli prime minister attended.\n\nIn Sharm el-Sheikh, Trump said he had been watching videos of the Israeli hostages being reunited with their families.\n\n\"The level of love and sorrow, I've never seen anything like it. It's amazing. They haven't seen their loved ones in such a long time,\" he said. \"In one sense, it's so horrible that this could take place. In another, it's so beautiful to see a new and beautiful day is rising.\"\n\nBeyond the welcoming crowd in Khan Younis, the response across Gaza to the mass detainee release was muted by the desperate circumstances and the nervousness over whether the ceasefire would stick. It was unclear how many of those freed on Monday were militants from Hamas or other armed groups, and how many had simply been swept up by Israeli forces.\n\nSome returned to meet new children born during their captivity. Others came back to find their relatives had been killed in a conflict that has seen a historically high rate of civilian casualties among Palestinians. A UN human rights commission has assessed Israel's actions constitute genocide.\n\nHaitham Salem, one of the detainees freed on Monday, discovered on his release that his wife and children had been killed and he was the sole survivor of his immediate family. Naji al-Jafarawi returned on the same day his brother Saleh, a social media journalist and activist, was being buried.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross, which oversaw the hostage and detainee transfers, conducting brief interviews with all those released on Monday, said it had also transferred the remains of four dead hostages to the Israeli authorities.\n\nHumanitarian workers said it was now a race against time to rush humanitarian assistance into Gaza. It has been reported that, under the ceasefire agreement, Israel will open five crossings into Gaza, including one leading from Egypt. Only one crossing, at Kerem Shalom between Gaza and Israel, has been open for aid deliveries throughout much of the conflict.\n\n\"With easing of movement and access restrictions in multiple areas, we were able to pre-position medical and emergency supplies to where they are needed most, assess key roads for explosive hazards, and support displaced families in flood-prone areas,\" Fletcher said, adding that Israel had given security clearance for 190,000 metric tons of humanitarian supplies to enter Gaza, including food, tent components, medicine and other essentials.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.4434315671202957,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Abdel Fattah el-Sisi\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Government of Egypt\",\n    \"role\": \"President\",\n    \"nationality\": \"EGY\",\n    \"quote\": \"Let the Gaza war be the last of wars in the region,\",\n    \"message\": \"The Egyptian president hopes that the war in Gaza will be the final conflict in the Middle East.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Tom Fletcher\",\n    \"organisation\": \"United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\",\n    \"role\": \"Head of the UN's humanitarian relief branch OCHA\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"Millions of Palestinians counting on lifesaving aid getting through at scale.

Wesam was the only survivor, but sustained serious wounds to her leg and abdomen, including a lacerated liver and kidney, and severe psychological trauma.\n\nUnicef said she was in \"urgent need of medical evacuation abroad for advanced treatment, particularly to save her left leg from the risk of amputation\".\n\nThe Israeli onslaught on Gaza has left thousands of children like Wesam in its wake - alone and often critically wounded. There are so many such children that overworked trauma surgeons simply scrawl WCNSF on their files.\n\n\"It is the first conflict that such a term was needed,\" said Kieran King, the humanitarian head of War Child, a UK-based charity and one of the organisations trying to protect and care for wounded orphans in Gaza. \"It was born out of the emergency medical teams, people who have worked across every conflict since forever, and coined this term WCNSF because they'd never had to deal with the child protection challenge on this scale.\"\n\nJacob Granger, an emergency coordinator for Médecins Sans Frontières now in Deir al-Balah, southern Gaza, said wounded children were being brought to MSF field hospitals without family members all the time.\n\nGranger said: \"We try to stabilise their situation and treat their wounds, but after treating someone, often there is no stability whatsoever for that person.\n\n\"It's not like there is a social fabric or social institution that is able to support children. There's a community mechanism, people who take care of children who have lost their parents, or there are other agencies who can try to find the family, if there is someone that's left, or an institution that could shelter orphans, but it's a drop in the ocean.\"\n\nUnicef said it provided \"short-term emergency care to children at high risk - lost, orphaned, and separated children - to provide immediate safety for children after an incident, while social workers trace family members who can provide long-term care for a child.\"\n\nWar Child is one of a small number of humanitarian organisations that get calls from the emergency clinics about WCNSF cases, and its social workers comb the displaced camps looking for unaccompanied children then try to match them with people in the camps who are prepared to look after them.\n\nAmong the children in one of the community centres supported by War Child is 13-year-old Radeh, who witnessed her mother being killed by a sniper, having already lost her father in the war.\n\n\"This left her with symptoms of shock, including being withdrawn and anxious, as well as suffering from headaches, stomach pain, nightmares and anxiety,\" a War Child report said, noting that Radeh was receiving support from specialists to \"manage overwhelming emotions\" and finding some comfort in activities such as drawing.\n\nKing said: \"In a usual conflict scenario, that would involve relatives, and we would provide follow-up support and make sure that safeguarding was accounted for and assessed.\n\n\"That's often not possible in Gaza, where children often don't have any surviving relatives, or at least none that can be identified or found, because it is chaos. People are in displacement camps and constantly being forcibly evacuated. In the case of Gaza, you need to find alternative care solutions, and there is a database of families who are willing to take in other children, who could then be assessed and supported and monitored.\"\n\nFinding such families is extremely hard when food is in such short supply. Badly wounded children, often with amputated limbs, have little chance of making the trip south in accordance with Israeli evacuation orders issued to the roughly 1 million residents of Gaza City.\n\nTo find a car that will take a wounded child can cost hundreds of dollars, often in cash, for which you have to pay a premium of about 40% - far beyond the means of most Gaza families. Anyone who remains in Gaza City has been deemed by the Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, as \"terrorists or terrorist supporters\", implying they are legitimate military targets.\n\nChildren, and especially boys, are increasingly grouping together for survival, looking in rubbish heaps for anything to eat or sell, or using their strength in numbers to group at food distribution points, an extremely risky tactic reflecting sheer desperation.\n\n\"There's a lot of children on the street during the day - whether they still have a family or not is more difficult to assess,\" Granger said, noting that the consequences of childhood trauma and the destruction of families are beginning to make themselves clear. \"What we see is that the behaviour of these children is abnormally aggressive. So you will find a six-year-old or an eight-year-old boy sometimes yelling at our car as if he was an angry 40-year-old man.\"\n\nThe mental harm inflicted on this generation of children in Gaza is incalculable, even for those who still have a family. Before he was injured, 12-year-old Ahmad Abu Hilal supplemented his family's tiny income by selling coffee in the sprawling al-Mawasi camp on Gaza's southern coast.\n\n\"He had big ambitions,\" his mother, Sabreen Abu Hilal, recalled. \"He dreamed of becoming wealthy, buying a Jeep to give me, and becoming a great doctor who could treat the wounded. He also loved football and dreamed of becoming a talented player. He was always working hard to make his dreams come true.\"\n\nAll those aspirations were ripped apart by an Israeli shell fired into a crowd in nearby Khan Younis, where Ahmad had gone to visit his aunt. Shrapnel tore off the back of one of his thighs.\n\n\"After the injury, Ahmad's physical and psychological condition deteriorated severely. His health and mental state have been in decline since then,\" his mother said. \"At first, he was unconscious. When he woke up, he was in shock and in severe pain. He kept crying and blaming himself, asking why he had gone there, even though he had no way of knowing what would happen.\"\n\nAhmad is still reliant on painkillers and needs his wound to be cleaned regularly.\n\n\"The doctors said his injury is extremely serious and that he will need a long time to recover,\" his mother said. \"My biggest fear is that he may never walk again or that his wound will not heal.\"\n\nThe bewilderment and anguish accompanying serious injury is exponentially greater for children without a family support network.\n\n\"Just imagine the mental health impact on a child who, each time they try to walk again, or stand up, which is a reflex, they would recall the moment when they lost their legs and the members of their family,\" Granger said. \"And this is for the rest of their life, knowing that physically and mentally the prerequisites for overcoming trauma, safety and security are impossible for the people here. Nowhere is safe in Gaza.\"</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.3518644653693616,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Kieran King\",\n    \"organisation\": \"War Child\",\n    \"role\": \"humanitarian head\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"It is the first conflict that such a term was needed.

He added that the pro-Palestine protests had been used by some as a \"despicable excuse to attack British Jews\".\n\nThe prime minister wrote in the newspaper: \"Today, on the anniversary of the atrocities of October 7, students are once again planning protests.\n\n\"This is not who we are as a country. It's un-British to have so little respect for others. And that's before some of them decide to start chanting hatred towards Jewish people all over again.\"\n\nHamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostages during an assault on southern Israel on 7 October 2023. The subsequent war resulted in more than 67,000 Palestinians dead and about 170,000 wounded by Israel, according to the Gaza health ministry. At least 460 people have died from starvation in the territory.,\n\nThe second anniversary of the attacks comes less than a week after knife-wielding Jihad Al-Shamie, 35, launched a terror attack outside Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue, in which two people died.\n\nAdrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66, were both killed in the attack, which unfolded on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar.\n\nStarmer said: \"Time does not diminish the evil we saw that day. The worst attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust. The brutal, cold-blooded torture and murder of Jews in their own homes. And the taking of hostages, including British citizens, some of whom remain in Gaza today.\"\n\nStarmer's message was repeated on Tuesday by the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, who told Sky News: \"There is, of course, within our country the fundamental right to protest. It's a cornerstone of our democracy.\n\n\"But my message is that, as we remember the awful atrocities that took place two years ago on October 7, I would just encourage those considering taking part in protests to pause, to reflect and to understand the deep sense of loss that many people in our country will be experiencing today, not least given the appalling attacks we saw at Manchester last week.\n\nThousands of people attended an event in Trafalgar Square in central London on Sunday to mark the two-year anniversary.

It calls for a ceasefire, the return of hostages still held by Hamas and a surge of aid into Gaza \"without interference ... through the United Nations and its agencies, and the Red Crescent\".\n\nDr Akihiro Seita, the Unrwa director of health and an author of the study, said more malnourished children would die unless there was an end to hostilities and \"unimpeded, competent, international humanitarian nutritional, medical, economic and social services\".\n\nThe study found two years of war had led to \"enormous nutritional consequences\" for tens of thousands of children across Gaza.\n\nResearchers used measurements of the circumference of the arms of 220,000 children aged between six months and five years old in Gaza between January 2024, and August 2025, when famine was declared in parts of Gaza by a UN-backed panel of independent experts.\n\nIn January 2024, 5% of children screened showed evidence of wasting, rising to nearly 9% six months later, researchers found. After Israel imposed severe aid restrictions from the end of 2024, the prevalence of wasting had almost doubled by January 2025.\n\nWhen a six-week ceasefire allowed more aid to enter Gaza, wasting declined significantly before Israel imposed a tight 11-week blockade in March. Though these restrictions were eased in May 2025, levels of wasting among screened children soared to nearly 16%, with almost a quarter of these suffering severe acute malnutrition, the most dangerous form of the condition.\n\nAmong the estimated total population of Gaza, this is equivalent to more than 54,600 children up to six years old who need emergency nutrition and medical care, including 12,800 severely wasted children, the researchers said.\n\nIsrael has accused Hamas of looting much of the aid reaching Gaza, but has not provided evidence of any significant amount of theft by the Islamist militant organisation. Cogat, the Israeli agency that controls the entry of aid into Gaza, also accused Hamas of deliberately preventing civilians accessing aid by firing rockets at aid distribution sites.\n\nBetween May and July, more than 1,400 Palestinians were killed seeking humanitarian assistance in Gaza, 859 in the vicinity of sites run by the US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and 514 along the routes of food convoys, according to the UN, which said that most of the killings were committed by the Israeli military.\n\nAid agencies say Israeli restrictions prevent much of the aid getting into Gaza, and conditions created by the war and Israeli strategic decisions have made it almost impossible for them to operate.\n\nDr Masako Horino, nutrition epidemiologist at Unrwa and lead scientist for the study, said that evidence from before the war indicated that children in Palestinian refugee families in the Gaza Strip were already \"food insecure\" but were only marginally underweight.\n\n\"Following two years of war and severe restrictions in humanitarian aid, tens of thousands of preschool aged children in the Gaza Strip are now suffering from preventable acute malnutrition and face an increased risk of mortality,\" Horino said.\n\nLeading child health experts and paediatricians said the study was particularly \"notable and important\" because it was the first major medical study to reveal the extent of malnutrition among children in Gaza after two years of war.\n\nWriting in a comment piece in the Lancet, Zulfiqar Bhutta, Jessica Fanzo, and Paul Wise, who were not involved in the research, said: \"It is now well established that the children of Gaza are starving and require immediate and sustained humanitarian assistance. The study by Horino and colleagues provides some of the most definitive evidence to date of this effect.\"\n\nBhutta, of the Hospital for Sick Children in Canada, Fanzo, of Columbia University and Wise, of Stanford University, also praised the researchers for using scientific evidence \"to show grievous, preventable harm to children\".\n\n\"These temporal data strongly suggest that restrictions on food and assistance have resulted in severe malnutrition among children in the Gaza Strip, a reality that will undoubtedly impact their future health and development outcomes for generations.\"\n\nAlthough attention has mostly focused on the short-term outcomes of starvation, there should also be \"serious concern\" over its long-term health effects, which included \"inordinately high risks of non-communicable diseases\", they added.\n\nOn Tuesday, Cogat said it \"continues to support international organisations facilitating food delivery and production for Gaza's civilian population\".\n\nThe study found that in Rafah, the southern city in Gaza, there was a fourfold increase in wasting malnutrition after Israel launched a massive offensive into the city and levelled it. There was then a sharp decline in April 2025 after the short-lived ceasefire.\n\nIn Gaza City, prevalence of wasting malnutrition rose more than fivefold from March 2025, reaching almost 30% in mid-August 2025.\n\nJames Elder, a spokesperson for Unicef, said last week that there was \"a lot of panic, a lot of very hungry people\" in Gaza City.\n\n\"It is very difficult to describe the levels of desperation there.

The officers had said that they would arrest Murton unless she provided her name and address, which she reluctantly agreed to do.\n\nResponding to the settlement of the case, Murton, who said she would donate any compensation to Palestinian causes, said: \"People should continue to exercise their lawful right to protest in support of Palestinian people despite the proscription of Palestine Action.

In 2014, a backbench Labour MP named Shabana Mahmood lay on the floor of her local Sainsbury's in protest against the sale of products made in illegal Israeli settlements. A week later, she spoke to crowds at a Free Palestine protest in Hyde Park, of the \"compassion and humanity expressed for the people of Gaza ... from every race and every religion.\"\n\nCompare and contrast with the 2025 Shabana Mahmood, now home secretary, whose new policies could see people arrested for the very same actions. She has just announced a fresh tranche of anti-protest policies that would allow police to re-route, and potentially shut down protests which repeatedly take place in the same area because of their cumulative impact.\n\nSo which Mahmood is in the right? Do these new proposals change anything, and if so, will they apply just to pro-Palestine marches or to far-right groups, too? To answer those questions, I spoke to Dr Richard Martin, an expert in the policing of protest at the London School of Economics. That's after the headlines.\n\nThe context for this weekend's announcement is obvious: on Thursday, a horrific attack took place at a synagogue in Manchester, on the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, claiming the lives of two people. It was one of the worst acts of antisemitic terrorism in modern British history.\n\nRather than focusing on what could be done to protect the Jewish community from such violence, or what may have gone wrong that allowed the perpetrator to be unknown to the Prevent programme, the government immediately took aim at pro-Palestine protesters, who have been marching regularly since the escalation of the war in Gaza, asking protesters instead to \"respect the grief of British Jews\". Mahmood called the decision to go ahead with another pro-Palestine protest \"fundamentally un-British\" and \"dishonourable\".\n\nThe protests over the weekend saw almost 500 of those protesting against the proscription of Palestine Action arrested (of those only four were for unrelated charges, such as common assault), and in response, the government put out an announcement on Sunday, saying it would amend sections 12 and 14 of the Public Order Act 1986 to further impose conditions on public protests and assemblies.\n\nThe changes to the law would allow police officers to consider the cumulative impact of protest when deciding whether or not they are lawful, meaning they could potentially re-route or totally shut down protest they believe could cause serious disruption to local communities. The changes are supposed to reference and respond to the real anxiety felt by many British Jews as a result of the antisemitism that can sometimes infect anti-Israel movements.\n\nIn the statement, the government made clear its intention for the changes: \"Large, repeated protests can leave sections of our country, particularly religious communities, feeling unsafe, intimidated and scared to leave their homes. This has been particularly evident in relation to the considerable fear within the Jewish community ... These changes mark an important step in ensuring we protect the right to protest while ensuring all feel safe in this country.\"\n\nWe've been here before\n\nDr Richard Martin points out that two years ago a different home secretary, the Conservative Suella Braverman, made a very similar announcement, only at that time in relation to the environmental protest group Extinction Rebellion. \"I think you could find exactly the same [sentiment] if you just replaced 'religious communities' with 'law-abiding people',\" he explained.\n\nWhen Braverman announced this two years ago, the Tories were looking at bringing in new powers under law to account for - you guessed it - the cumulative impact of regular protest. But crucially, they failed. The human rights organisation Liberty won an initial judicial review against the Home Office in May 2024, with the court deciding that its threshold for what constitutes \"serious disruption\" was too low. This year, a subsequent appeal against that judgment was brought under Keir Starmer's government, which lost again in May this year.\n\nSo although the Labour party has given the Manchester attack as the reason for this announcement, it pertains to a longstanding Conservative policy the Labour government has sought to push through.\n\nThere are two key differences to how Labour will institute the change this time around, which Martin thinks makes it more likely to succeed. The first, he explained, is that it seems Labour won't use the same low threshold of \"more than minor\" disruption that was ruled unlawful by the courts; and secondly, they won't try to slip the change in through regulations, but instead by amending the 1986 act - which will include greater parliamentary involvement and scrutiny, but also, makes it harder to subsequently amend.\n\nThe mood music\n\nIf you've been at any protest in the past few decades, you'll know that police often reroute protesters, restrict them through kettling, or tell them to move on and protest elsewhere. Do these new laws really represent a serious difference?\n\nMartin thinks they do - but more as a vibe shift than anything else. \"Crucially, the government is trying to send a signal to the police: to get tougher, less tolerant and to put more weight on the other side of the scales,\" he said. \"What happens next depends on how susceptible senior police officers are to the mood music.\"\n\nThere is an excellent quote from Gordon Brown, who was in opposition when the Public Order Act was passed, which Martin references: \"there are as many views as there are policemen as to what constitutes serious disruption to the life of the community\". As Martin explained: \"It's such a wide term - if the police wanted to, I am quite sure they could [enforce this] already.\"\n\nBut it's not a given that they will be susceptible to the government's song. In recent weeks, the images coming out of the protests over Palestine Action - a blind man in his 60s being walked out by a procession of officers; everyone from a Catholic priest to an 81-year-old woman with an OBE being arrested for quietly holding placards - have posed a serious legitimacy problem for the police. \"Getting arrested for the cause is part of the tactic,\" explained Martin. \"And the broader question of whether the police want to be seen every weekend making these mass arrests is a real issue for them.\" After all, the Met is hardly free from reputational issues at the moment.\n\nThe death of a cause\n\nUltimately, it's not clear protesters have any intention of slowing down, and since police officers will be able to interpret these law changes as they wish, this could all still be seriously bad news for those who take to the street.\n\n\"The key problem is, if the police get it wrong and they impose restrictions that are disproportionate, you're not going to find out about that until long after the offence, and [even then a protester would need] the power, money and clout to challenge that through a judicial review,\" explained Martin.\n\nIn recent years, protesters have sought to justify their actions in court with a defence that they had a \"reasonable\" or \"lawful\" excuse if they had broken the law, in effect, requiring the prosecution to justify why a conviction outweighs the right to peaceful protest. For the public order offences Labour are seeking to attach cumulative impact to, the courts have held firm that there will be no allowance for such a defence.\n\nI ask Martin why these same laws aren't being suggested to police far-right rallies, particularly given the government justification of wanting to make sure that communities feel protected and free from intimidation.\n\n\"I think we need to be upfront about what's prompted this,\" he said. \"It's not far-right rallies. The target to begin with was Extinction Rebellion, and now it's Palestine Action.\" He thinks that it is the shared tactic of these two groups - which he defined as \"a campaign of attrition where you keep protesting to effectively exhaust the police, to fill the custody suites\" - that the government legislation is actually targeted at.\n\n\"Their approach ... will potentially be met by police gradually breaking that technique down,\" Martin explained. \"It will mean there may be a greater number of arrests, the stakes for those arrested will be higher and we may well see less protest.\"\n\nRugby union | Lewis Moody, the former England rugby captain and 2003 World Cup winner, has been diagnosed with motor neurone disease. The 47-year-old told the BBC he was having trouble accepting what the news meant for his future, and for his family, though his symptoms were relatively mild.\n\nFootball | Steven Gerrard is under strong consideration for a return to Rangers after the Scottish club confirmed the sacking of Russell Martin. Martin's ill-fated Ibrox tenure ended with the manager leaving the Falkirk Stadium via a side door and a waiting car after a 1-1 draw which left Rangers 11 points from the summit of Scotland's top flight after just seven games.\n\nFormula One | Lando Norris delivered an uncompromising riposte to the complaints of his angry McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri after the pair clashed at the Singapore Grand Prix, declaring that anyone who would not attempt a similar overtake \"should not be in Formula One\".\n\nOn the face of it, Donald Trump's 20-point Gaza plan looked far from promising. It was created with a notable lack of Palestinian input, at a time when Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was mounting a ferocious attack on Gaza City. Yet now negotiators are gathering in Cairo and there is real momentum behind the talks. The Guardian's diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour discusses what an agreement might look like.\n\nA bit of good news to remind you that the world's not all bad\n\n\"As a child I devoured books until my eyes blurred,\" says the Guardian's Emma Loffhagen.

The anti-Israel campaigning and lawfare will grind on. UN committees and commissions - in which countries as respectful of human rights as China, Qatar and Ethiopia are represented - will publish reports and recommendations.\n\nGreta Thunberg will keep going, at least for the time being. But Gary Lineker, Benedict Cumberbatch, Steve Coogan and others may not. It's one thing to call, as they did, for a ceasefire. It would be quite another to give cover, in the aftermath of a peace deal, to calls for a Palestine \"from the river to the sea\".\n\nAbove all, the Trump deal has revealed a growing divide between many Muslims in the West and their co-religionists in the Middle East. It goes almost without saying that there is no love for the Jewish state on the Arab street. But even governments as hostile to Israel as those of Turkey and Pakistan have thrown their weight behind the Trump plan. A combination of exasperation with Hamas, fear of Israel's military projection, exhaustion with the war and recognition of American power have driven them and others to sign up, squeeze Hamas's backing and funding, and \"give peace a chance\".\n\nAnd if Trump's attention doesn't wander elsewhere, it will return to a theme of his first term - the Abraham Accords, signed in 2020 by the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan, which furthered co-operation in trade, security and technology.\n\nThe big fish which Trump would hope to hook is Saudi Arabia. This may well be impossible without some move towards a Palestinian state on the West Bank. But a Gaza settlement would open new doors. Egypt and Jordan already have peace treaties with Israel. The strategic position of Iran in the region has been weakened by the collapse of the Assad regime, the bombing of its nuclear facilities and the degradation of Hezbollah. It may even be that Syria is drawn in to the Abraham Accords' ambit and Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim country, may sign up.\n\nOf the 17 countries that have submitted arguments supporting South Africa's genocide claims against Israel at the International Court of Justice, only three are from the Middle East: Libya, Egypt and Turkey. How hard and energetically would the last two - backers as they are of the Trump proposals - push their participation in the event of peace in Gaza?\n\nThere is no moral equivalence between the indiscriminate massacres of October 7 and Israel's actions in Gaza (for all the horrifying rhetoric of the country's own extremists). But if Hamas leaders complicit in the slaughter are allowed to leave Gaza, and Hamas members involved in it have been freed from Israeli prisons, realpolitik suggests some quid pro quo, including the easing of lawfare against the Jewish state.\n\nThere is a case for claiming that Israel has paid too high a price in lost lives and diplomatic heft for Benjamin Netanyahu's intervention in Gaza: many within Israel itself have argued that he has drawn the country into a long war that it can't win - with dire consequences for innocent Palestinian lives. So it may be.\n\nBut for all Trump's frequent impatience with Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister could turn out to the peace deal's big winner - with Hezbollah, Syria, Iran and Hamas tamed and Emmanuel Macron, Sir Keir Starmer, and Europe marginalised. The West's Islamists would struggle to come to terms with a Middle East shaped by the Abraham Accords.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-165.5459442138672,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"[]"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP"}],"createTime":"2025-10-15T10:36:59.831191Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"S3nvaNfdMr6onvgPoZngkAo","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1}],"promptTokenCount":1139,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1139}],"thoughtsTokenCount":581,"totalTokenCount":1721,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}}}

Last month, that appeared to change\n\nAfter nearly nine months in office, Donald Trump seems to have had enough of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, undermining his ambition to establish himself as a global peacemaker. Over the past few weeks, the US president finally decided to use his leverage to force Netanyahu to accept a new ceasefire and stop two years of genocidal war in Gaza.\n\nOn Thursday, Israel and Hamas agreed to the first phase of Trump's peace plan for Gaza, including an exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners and a partial withdrawal of Israeli troops from the territory. It's unclear what guarantees the US gave to Hamas and Arab mediators to ensure that Netanyahu would not resume the war after the hostage-prisoner swap - if negotiations on later stages of the deal are stalled. That's what happened earlier this year, when Netanyahu accepted a truce that took effect in January, but then refused to move into the second phase of negotiations with Hamas, and violated the ceasefire after two months.\n\nBack in March, Trump was still enamored with his preposterous idea for the US to take control of Gaza and turn it into a \"Riviera of the Middle East\", displacing 2 million Palestinians. He showed little interest in pressuring Netanyahu to negotiate with Hamas to extend the ceasefire. But in recent weeks, Trump has become personally invested in ending the Gaza war - and his ego might be the one thing that keeps him engaged in preserving a peace agreement that essentially carries his name.\n\nIt's been clear since Trump took office that he's the only world leader who could effectively pressure Netanyahu to end Israel's war, which has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians and triggered a famine in parts of Gaza. The president has considerable leverage over the Israeli premier: billions of dollars in American weapons and constant diplomatic support for Israel at the UN security council, including multiple US vetoes of ceasefire resolutions over the past two years. Like his predecessor Joe Biden, who provided Israel with a virtually unlimited supply of weapons after the October 2023 Hamas attack, Trump also refused to use his influence over Netanyahu. That allowed Israel to defy global outrage and isolation, and continue its onslaught.\n\nFor two years, Netanyahu has repeatedly sabotaged negotiations and torpedoed potential deals by adding new conditions. He prolonged the war in an evident effort to avoid early parliamentary elections and block an inquiry into his government's security failures that led to the Hamas attack. His clinging to power also delayed a corruption trial based on an earlier stint as prime minister.\n\nTrump, who has faced his own series of charges and convictions in US courts, expressed empathy for Netanyahu, calling the legal case against the Israeli leader a \"witch-hunt\" that should be thrown out. Last year, the international criminal court issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu on charges of using starvation as a method of warfare and other crimes against humanity - and the Trump administration recently retaliated by imposing sanctions against four ICC officials.\n\nBut Trump appears to have soured on Netanyahu last month, after Israel launched an attack against Qatar, targeting senior Hamas leaders who were meeting in Doha to consider a ceasefire proposal submitted by Arab and US mediators. The Hamas officials, including the group's top negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, survived the airstrike on 9 September. But the attack outraged Qatar's leaders, along with other US allies in the region, especially Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. These three wealthy Gulf petrostates have each spent tens of billions of dollars on US weapons and other military assistance over the past two decades. They also all happen to have ongoing deals with Trump's family business for branded real estate projects, hotels and golf resorts worth billions of dollars.\n\nTwo weeks after the attack on Qatar, Trump met with a group of Arab and Muslim leaders on the sidelines of the UN general assembly. The US administration then circulated a 21-point peace plan that emerged from that meeting, which included a ceasefire, a hostage-prisoner swap, a phased Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a transitional government led by an international body. The proposal also envisioned creating a temporary governing board for the territory that would be headed by Trump and would include Tony Blair, the former British prime minister.\n\nTrump planned to host Netanyahu at the White House on 29 September, and started pressuring the Israeli leader to prepare for a joint announcement. In the days leading up to that meeting, Netanyahu spent hours negotiating with two Trump confidants who had taken a lead role in drafting the new plan: Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, and Steve Witkoff, the president's longtime friend and Middle East envoy.\n\nAccording to reports in the Israeli press, Netanyahu managed to make significant changes to the plan that Trump had negotiated with Arab and Muslim leaders. The prime minister altered the timing of Israeli troop withdrawals, enabling Israel to temporarily keep its forces in more than half of Gaza's territory, even after Hamas released all of the Israeli hostages. Netanyahu also won concessions on requirements for Hamas to disarm and Israeli troops being able to control a \"security perimeter\" inside Gaza until the territory is \"properly secure from any resurgent terror threat\". That could mean Israel would keep its forces in a section of Gaza indefinitely.\n\nAt their White House announcement, Trump and Netanyahu presented the plan as an ultimatum for Hamas to release the hostages and lay down its weapons, or face even more severe Israeli attacks - it was framed more as a surrender than a ceasefire. In a video posted after his meeting with Trump, Netanyahu boasted that he got everything he wanted out of the US president. \"Now the whole world, including the Arab and Muslim world, is pressuring Hamas to accept the terms that we created together with Trump, to bring back all the hostages - the living and the dead - while the IDF stays in the Strip,\" Netanyahu said in Hebrew, in a message aimed at a domestic Israeli audience. \"Who would have believed it?\"\n\nIndeed, some Arab officials worried that Hamas would reject the plan, partly because of Netanyahu's last-minute amendments that reduced Israel's commitment to fully withdraw from Gaza and to end the war.\n\nHamas, which was facing pressure from two allies, Qatar and Turkey, did not refuse Trump's deal, but didn't fully embrace it. On 3 October, the group announced that it accepted some elements of the plan, while downplaying several key provisions, including those requiring it to disarm and give up any future role in governing Gaza. Hamas's response was a qualified yes that called for more negotiations - and Netanyahu tried to frame it as a rejection of Trump's proposal.\n\nBut the president jumped on the Hamas statement and finally pushed Netanyahu into accepting that an agreement was within reach. After Hamas issued its response, Axios reported that Trump had a tense call with Netanyahu, in which Trump snapped at the prime minister: \"I don't know why you're always so fucking negative. This is a win. Take it.\"\n\nTrump's willingness to strong-arm Netanyahu was the key to achieving the initial deal that is supposed to lead to the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners in the coming days. The president will need to sustain that pressure on Netanyahu to make sure he doesn't blow up the ceasefire, as he did in March, and resume Israel's brutal war.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.9193772041267199,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Donald Trump\",\n    \"organisation\": \"President of the United States\",\n    \"role\": \"President\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"Riviera of the Middle East\",\n    \"message\": \"The United States had an idea to transform Gaza into a luxurious tourist destination.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Donald Trump\",\n    \"organisation\": \"President of the United States\",\n    \"role\": \"President\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"witch-hunt\",\n    \"message\": \"The legal case against the Israeli leader was an unfair and politically motivated persecution.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Benjamin Netanyahu\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Government of Israel\",\n    \"role\": \"Prime Minister\",\n    \"nationality\": \"ISR\",\n    \"quote\": \"Now the whole world, including the Arab and Muslim world, is pressuring Hamas to accept the terms that we created together with Trump, to bring back all the hostages - the living and the dead - while the IDF stays in the Strip.

When Amirah moved it away, she saw a long, deep cut across her daughter's neck. A man had approached her on the playground, grabbed her head and slit her throat with a knife.\n\n\"My mind flipped. I didn't know where I was,\" Amirah recalls.\n\n\"My son was screaming: 'Don't die! Don't die!' I didn't even know how to dial 911.\"\n\nThe accused, 73-year-old Gary Lansky, who lives near the park, was caught shortly afterwards and in January was found competent to stand trial for assault with intent to murder and other charges.\n\n\"For a mom to see her daughter's throat open. It was terrifying,\" says Amirah.\n\n\"He's a 73-year-old. How could he do that to a little child?\"\n\nSaida received 20 stitches and is scarred mentally and physically. Most of her nights are still filled with nightmares.\n\nAmirah is convinced her daughter and mother were targeted for being Muslims; the attack happened two days after the first anniversary of Hamas's terrorist attack on Israel and her grandmother was the only visibly Muslim person in the park.\n\nThat the accused was not ultimately charged with committing hate crimes has angered the local Muslim and Arab American communities who have been feeling abandoned and afraid since 7 October 2023. Those sentiments increased support for Donald Trump, but some are reassessing that support amid the continued killing in Gaza and ongoing threats against their community.\n\nIslamophobic attacks across the US have risen precipitously in the two years since Hamas's attack on Israel, which killed about 1,200 people, and the ensuing destruction Israel has unleashed on Gaza that has killed more than 67,000 people and devastated the Strip. Last year, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair) recorded 8,658 complaints, a record.\n\nReports of antisemitism have also surged in recent years - a report released on Sunday found that more than half of American Jews say they have faced antisemitism in the past year. Data is difficult to come by because some sources tracking antisemitism don't make clear distinctions between anti-Zionism and anti-Jewish hate. However, synagogues have widely reported increasing their security budgets over violent threats, and Jewish institutions are especially unnerved after two people were killed in an attack on a UK synagogue last week.\n\n\"Since the Pittsburgh synagogue bombing of 2018, in which 11 Jews were killed at worship, there have been anti-Jewish attacks in Poway, California (at a synagogue), Jersey City, New Jersey (at a kosher grocery store), at a rabbi's house in Monsey, New York, and at the Coleyville, Texas, synagogue,\" Mark Oppenheimer, of the John C Danforth Center on Religion and Politics at Washington University in St Louis, Missouri, wrote in an email.\n\nWhile Muslim and Jewish communities face attacks that are often connected to anger over the Israel-Gaza war, a tense political climate in the US appears to be encouraging violence more broadly. After a recent shooting at a Mormon church in Michigan, the Washington Post reported mounting anxiety on the part of groups across religions. \"No matter what level of violence you look at, violence against faith-based organizations is increasing,\" said Carl Chinn, head of the Faith Based Security Network, a non-profit association of security professionals.\n\nBut Dearborn, the US's first majority-Arab-American city, home to many residents who have lost family members to Israeli bombardments in Gaza and Lebanon, seems to attract particular vitriol.\n\nLast month, a mosque in neighboring Dearborn Heights received a call from a Texas man threatening to burn down Dearborn and its mosques. On 23 September, a Virginia man was arraigned in court on terrorism charges for threatening on YouTube to attack a mosque in Dearborn.\n\nIn August, a man in a neighboring city was arrested for writing on social media that he would like to see marchers at a Muslim religious event taking place in Dearborn that month be shot. Dearborn officials have also recently been targeted by pro-Israel groups.\n\nResidents report growing racism platformed on rightwing media outlets. In recent weeks, Fox News has devoted significant attention to Dearborn, highlighting, for example, noise complaints about mosques and an alleged dispute between a local pastor and the city's Lebanese American mayor.\n\nArab Americans have come in for criticism in some quarters for voting for Trump in last November's election. In Dearborn, a city of 106,000 people of whom about 55% have Arab ancestry, Trump won 42.5% of the presidential election vote, more than any other candidate, helping deliver Michigan, a crucial swing state, to the president. Arab American leaders in Michigan were incensed by the Democratic party and former presidential candidate Kamala Harris's support for Israel's war on Gaza.\n\nNow, interviews with some of those who backed Trump last year suggest that support may be eroding.\n\nFaye Nemer, the founder of the Dearborn-based Mena American Chamber of Commerce, which works to build economic and cultural exchanges between organizations in the Middle East and US, says that many among the Arab American community who backed Trump in last year's election did so on the premise that he would be a president of peace. She was among a cohort of Arab Americans who welcomed and organized Trump's visit to Dearborn just days before the presidential election last November.\n\n\"We're cautiously optimistic about this ceasefire deal [but] it's become somewhat problematic - what was promised during the campaign cycle versus what we're seeing occur on the ground,\" she says.\n\nNemer says she believes there's a shifting of opinion in the Arab American community. \"I think they are in for a rude awakening come the midterm elections,\" she said of the Republican party. \"There should be some introspection there.\"\n\nBut in addition to fear and disappointment, there is also defiance.\n\nOn Saturday, dozens of people marched in Dearborn's streets in protest of the ongoing bombardment of Gaza and the detention of members of the Global Sumud Flotilla by Israel. At a convention held in Dearborn last month, Michigan's lieutenant-governor, Garlin Gilchrist, called Israel's war on Gaza a genocide, becoming one of a tiny but growing number of US politicians to do so. Gilchrist is running for governor of Michigan as a Democrat in next year's election.\n\nIn the meantime, Saida Sharhan has had to move to a new school because of her former school's proximity to the site of the attack. The park that's a short distance from her home where she once played with her friends is now off limits.\n\n\"Two days ago, she woke up me and her father, screaming. She was shaking,\" Amirah, her mother, says.\n\n\"She told me it's the same dream all the time - the park is full of blood and [the attacker] telling her: 'I'm coming back for you.'\"\n\n\"I don't feel safe any more,\" says Amirah, \"like I used to.\"</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.35258898639038905,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Amirah Sharhan\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"My mind flipped.

For the state of Israel, it was deeply humiliating. The entire Zionist project was founded on the presumption that the Jewish state would prevent things like this from ever happening again.\n\nA response was inevitable. But the response Israel pursued - the obliteration of Gaza, the killing and maiming of tens of thousands of civilians - was a choice. And this choice complicated how many American Jews processed the attack that set it in motion, and it now complicates the community's commemoration of the day. How does one mourn and commemorate an atrocity against your people in the midst of an atrocity done to another people in your name?\n\nThe complexity of mourning lies in the fact that there is no consensus as to what any of this means. In fact, for the American Jewish community, the last two years have seen the collapse of a half-century-old consensus on Zionism itself.\n\nThe beginnings of a Zionist consensus among American Jewry extends as far back as a 1915 essay by the lawyer and then future supreme court justice Louis Brandeis titled \"The Jewish Problem; How to Solve it\". But the consensus really takes hold after the six-day war in 1967. Before then, American Jewry housed a fragile but stable coexistence between groups that had a range of views about the necessity of a Jewish state - Zionists, non-Zionists and anti-Zionists.\n\nThat coexistence persisted through the 1950s and 60s, in remnants of Jewish socialism, in the non-Zionist American Jewish Committee, in the anti-Zionist American Council for Judaism and other organizations. For Louis Finkelstein, the chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary, Zionism was more spiritual than political, and he did not permit singing Hatikvah, the Israeli national anthem, at JTS ordinations in the early 1960s. Nor were Zionism and pro-Israelism the centerpiece of Modern Orthodoxy until after the six-day war. Jewish identitarian alternatives coexisted.\n\nBut after Israel routed its neighbors in the six-day war in 1967, occupying territories including the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Golan Heights and East Jerusalem, the American Jewish relationship to the country changed dramatically. Israel's victory, along with longstanding fears of a \"second Holocaust\", resulted in a growing belief in the country's critical importance to the Jewish people, and a source of pride in its resilience. Rhetoric about the \"miraculous\" nature of the victory and the \"liberation\" of land gave the Zionist project a religious, even messianic, significance. In those heady years, much of the remaining ambivalence about Zionism disappeared. In the early 1970s, Commentary magazine editor Norman Podhoretz famously proclaimed: \"We are all Zionists now.\"\n\nThe Zionist consensus excluded the ultra-Orthodox - who largely believed a Jewish state should only be ushered in by a traditional rendering of the messiah - but united Reform, Conservative, Modern Orthodox and most non-affiliated Jews. The most popular form of the consensus, what became known as liberal Zionism, was founded on a belief in Israel as a liberal and democratic - albeit ethnocentric - state. Many American Jews saw the occupation of Palestinian, Syrian and Egyptian lands after 1967 as temporary, believing that a solution was forthcoming that would ensure a Jewish majority in pre-1967 Israel and regional acceptance of the state.\n\nTwo generations of American Jews were thus brought up with Zionism a core part of their Jewish identity. Israel became a central part of Jewish education. Israel's Independence Day became a Jewish holiday. Israeli flags adorned most synagogues. Summer camps became infused with Israeli songs and the study of modern Hebrew, with Israelis visiting and teaching American youth Israeli culture. Visits to Israel increased and reached new heights with Birthright Israel in 1999, when a free trip to Israel was offered to young American Jews. Israel permeated almost the entirety of the American Jewish experience.\n\nIronically, in these decades after 1967, American Jewry became adept at religious pluralism. Tolerance and dialogue between Jewish denominations increased.\n\nExcept when it came to Zionism and Israel - that's where pluralism reached its limit. You could be a rightwing Zionist or a leftwing Zionist, but support for Israel as a Jewish state was a given, and questioning that narrative placed you outside the consensus - an \"Un-Jew\", as Tablet magazine termed it in an essay in 2021.\n\nBut now, under the weight of the destruction of Gaza, famine, dead and orphaned children, and anger over the denial of many fellow Jews who refuse to recognize their complicity, that consensus has collapsed. The liberal Zionist \"center\" has lost its hegemonic hold on American Jewry.\n\nFor some, that has meant a move to the right; after 7 October many American Jews defended Israel's actions as necessary and justifiable. Witnessing Israel's response prompted others to move to the left and question the Zionist project entirely. That is especially true for young American Jews on the left, for whom anti-Zionism has as much to do with redefining their own Jewish identity as it does with their critique of the country.\n\nRecently, Arielle Angel, the editor-in-chief of Jewish Currents wrote a piece titled: \"We need new Jewish institutions\". They have arrived, in many forms: new and growing non- or anti-Zionist congregations and minyanim (Jewish prayer groups); the precipitous rise in membership in non-Zionist Jewish organizations such as Jewish Voice for Peace or IfNotNow; the founding of at least one non-Zionist Jewish Day School in Somerville, MA; a revival of interest in Yiddish language and culture; non-Zionist Jewish student groups (there are three at Harvard where I teach); the rise in popularity of Jewish Currents; and a new organization called The Jewish Left out of Boston University. (The Jewish Left's 2025 conference had about 800 attenders; in 2024 there were about 300.) These are just a few examples.\n\nLiberal Zionism remains on the scene in many synagogues and institutional Jewish life - but increasingly finds itself on the defensive, against both the right and the left. Its message - that Israel can return to some sort of \"Jewish and democratic\" path that arguably never existed - has become almost inchoate. Meanwhile, Israel becomes more and more illiberal, a two-state solution seems almost absurdly utopian, and a one-state reality - where Israel controls all of the territory and dominion of all its people between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean sea - becomes entrenched.\n\nWe find ourselves at a moment where the compatibility of \"liberalism\" and \"Zionism\" feels increasingly untenable. How can a state that privileges its Jewish citizens while so egregiously devaluing the lives of the Palestinians under its control ever be called liberal? Basic principles of liberalism that include equality and the protection of individual rights for all do not cohere with present-day Israel even on a generous reading. The permanent occupation, to say nothing of the destruction of Gaza, has undermined any plausible claim to Israel as a \"liberal\" country.\n\nThis rift has caused significant damage in American Jewry. It has spurred family feuds, broken friendships, attempts to ostracize those who oppose Israel, and even cases of people being denied or fired from jobs in Jewish communal life.\n\nOver the last two years, I have heard liberal Zionists say that this disaffection is likely temporary, assuming young Jews will return to the fold when the war ends. I think that is a mistake. For many of these talented and energetic young Jews, the liberal Zionist narrative is in their rearview mirror. They are building a new Jewish future and new institutions where Israel may or may not play a role - but it will not be at the center.\n\nIs this schism good for American Jewry? Not only do I think it is, I think it is essential to the health of Jewish life. Hannah Arendt reminds us that ideological hegemony is never good for any collective; hegemony yields laziness and overconfidence and is ultimately self-destructive. In her 1948 essay, To Save the Jewish Homeland, she writes:\n\nUnanimity of opinion is a very ominous phenomenon, and one characteristic of our modern mass age. It destroys social and personal life, which is based on the fact that we are different by nature and by conviction. To hold different opinions and to be aware that other people think differently on the same issue shields us from that Godlike certainty which stops all discussion and reduces social relationships to those of an ant heap.\n\nIn Origins of Totalitarianism she wrote that such hegemony can be a first stage of totalitarianism in a polity with power. Jews in America do not have the kind of power she was referring to, but they do have responsibility for the health of their collective. Ideological hegemony is not healthy.\n\nZionism in America will continue, and it may even thrive. But it will no longer serve as a gatekeeper to Jewish life. If American Zionists continue to deny a place at the table for those who are not Zionists, they will fade into increasing irrelevance as young Jews build institutions of their own. And they will soon attain considerable resources and power.\n\nThe first anniversary of any tragedy is focused on the proximate past. In Judaism, the first anniversary is ritualized in some communities as an \"unveiling\" of the tombstone. The second anniversary has no unique ritual - perhaps because it heralds a turn from the past to the future. That does not mean the time for commemoration is over. But the distance allows for a view of the consequences and repercussions of the tragedy.\n\nMore than 2,000 years ago, when Jewish leaders knew the Jerusalem Temple would fall, they left it behind and constructed a new Jewish future. What they created is what we understand as Judaism. In our time we can construct a more pluralistic vision of Judaism that includes both Zionists and diasporists - those Jews outside Israel who de-emphasize the role of the state in their Jewish identity.\n\nNew growth always sprouts from such precarious moments. Part of our job is to cultivate a productive future rather than only lament what has fallen. For Jews, 7 October and the destruction of Gaza are the tragedies of our time. The death and destruction of innocents can never be rectified, and can never be justified, but we still must build a future from the wreckage. Friedrich Nietzsche stated it plainly: \"If a temple is to be erected a temple must be destroyed; that is the law.\"</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.148355231915329,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":2039,"startIndex":1822,"uri":"https://prospect.org/politics/2023-10-30-congress-censure-rashida-tlaib/"},{"endIndex":3480,"startIndex":3263,"uri":"https://prospect.org/politics/2023-10-30-congress-censure-rashida-tlaib/"},{"endIndex":7700,"startIndex":7483,"uri":"https://prospect.org/politics/2023-10-30-congress-censure-rashida-tlaib/"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Norman Podhoretz\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Commentary magazine\",\n    \"role\": \"editor\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"We are all Zionists now.\",\n    \"message\": \"The entire community has embraced Zionism.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Arielle Angel\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Jewish Currents\",\n    \"role\": \"editor-in-chief\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"We need new Jewish institutions\",\n    \"message\": \"There is a need for the creation of new Jewish institutions.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Hannah Arendt\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"Unanimity of opinion is a very ominous phenomenon, and one characteristic of our modern mass age.

The indictment does not identify the associate or say what information may have been discussed with the media.\n\nThough an indictment is typically just the start of a protracted court process, the Justice Department has trumpeted the development itself as something of a win.\n\nTrump administration officials are likely to point to any conviction as proof the case was well-justified, but an acquittal or even dismissal may also be held up as further support for their long-running contention that the criminal justice system is stacked against them.\n\nThe judge randomly assigned to the case, Michael Nachmanoff, is a Biden administration appointee.

And they do, with the solemn seriousness of a child who has been given a job to do by an adult they don't know.\n\nBut with every new silly instruction (and this hasn't changed in the 40 years he has been singing it), they get gigglier. Even the 10- and 11-year-olds - the hardest people to win over in any room, according to Combe, because by then they've learned what it means to be cool.\n\n\"Clean your teeth with bubble gum,\" he sings, then: \"Fix the fence with sticky tape / Brush your hair with a toothbrush / Fry an egg on a slippery dip.\"\n\nBy the time Combe's telling them to \"belly flop in a pizza\", even the 10- and 11-year-olds are smiling and shouting and bouncing along with the six-year-olds, the room united in a delighted, anarchic screech. Belly flop in a pizza?\n\n\"Kids just wait for that line. It's the one song I never, ever have to teach. It seems to be known by every child in the country,\" Combe says. He calls the song his American Pie; at the thousands of shows he has played at schools, festivals and libraries across the country, he always plays it last. If he skips it, people complain.\n\n\"I'm glad it is not eight minutes long, otherwise I'd be insane by now,\" he adds. \"It's lovely that kids love it to bits. That still gets to me. I'd love to give it a two-year rest, but I can't. I just can't.\"\n\nA few years ago, Combe, who has built a second career in performing for the adults who listened to him as children, was booked to play a show at a university in Melbourne. All the twentysomethings streamed into the quadrangle with their newspaper hats and toffee apples, and sang all the lyrics that had survived somewhere in the back of their brains. And when Combe got to Mr Clicketty Cane and \"belly flop in a pizza\", one student stepped forth and took off his shirt.\n\n\"He laid an enormous pizza on the ground, and simply belly flopped into it,\" says Combe. \"He got an enormous cheer, of course.\"\n\nHe tells this story with the ease of someone who has not only told it many times, but relived it in his mind again and again with astonished delight. \"I think silliness is very underrated,\" he tells me later. \"It's a wonderful thing to be silly. I've spent so much of my life laughing.\"\n\nCombe is about to turn 77. I remember him, as many millennial Australians would, as he was in the video for his 1987 hit Toffee Apple, which seemed to always be on the ABC; or the various times he turned up at one of my schools and put on a raucous show in the library. He's just greyer now; his bulging blue eyes, so good for pulling faces, haven't changed at all. He still runs five times a week.\n\n\"Probably stating the bleeding obvious, but I do have less energy,\" he says. \"I'm in self-denial.\"\n\nCombe was a children's singer-songwriter a good decade BWE (Before Wiggles Era); his first kids' album, Songs for Little Kids, came out in 1982. This was when children's music was just nursery rhymes; record labels didn't believe children could appreciate music. But Combe built a cottage industry selling Songs for Little Kids - recorded himself - to his friends, then their friends, then friends of friends of friends: \"I sold hundreds of them, entirely by word of mouth. And I could tell almost straight away that this was going to happen.\"\n\n(\"This\", meaning a 40-year career.)\n\n\"All false modesty aside, I was a pioneer,\" Combe adds. \"Literally no one was doing it. I had no interest in singing nursery rhymes. I remember thinking, there are authors all over the world who write new stories for children - why don't people write them new songs?\"\n\nCombe has recorded 18 albums, won three Arias and sold more than 1m albums and DVDs. There are the boppy classics - Newspaper Mama, Toffee Apple, Spaghetti Bolognaise - but he has also done Christmas albums and lullabies.\n\n\"There's a misconception that children just react to fast, dancey, up-tempo stuff. They do, but they also like the soft songs as well,\" he says. \"You should never underestimate a child. You don't know what they're thinking.\"\n\nHe has always been focused on the music; even when he sold out Sydney Opera House (twice), Combe went out with his \"rickety little keyboard\" and not much else. \"No production values, whatsoever!\" he laughs. And he's indifferent to the noise around the music, like merchandise: \"The Wiggles have endless merch and I think a lot of it is just junk,\" he says. \"I'd much rather spend the time on what matters, which is the music.\"\n\nYears ago, a woman came up to him after a show in Melbourne and told him that one of his songs, Music of the Day, had saved her life.\n\n\"It stopped her from taking her own life. You could say that was a boost to ego,\" Combe reflects, \"but it was more an extraordinary example of the power of music.\"\n\nIn 2003, when 100,000 people took to Adelaide's streets to march against John Howard's plan to send Australian troops to Iraq, some may have been surprised to see Mr Clicketty Cane at the front, singing Joni Mitchell's anti-war anthem The Fiddle and the Drum. (Beginning as it does: \"And so once again / My dear Johnny, my dear friend ... \")\n\nBut Combe came of age during the Vietnam war and was educated by the likes of Bob Dylan, Paul Simon, Leonard Cohen and Mitchell. \"Musicians with a real sense of justice, social responsibility,\" he says. \"I was very affected by it. It's part of my DNA.\n\n\"So when something like Gaza is happening, it's very hard to ignore it,\" he adds. \"Children are being slaughtered, on a daily basis, for almost two years. Our ability to ignore it astounds me. You can talk to any NGO, they all say the same thing - it's a genocide. How can we turn a blind eye?\"\n\nCombe has written songs about Iraq (\"an appalling thing - I can't bear Howard being deified now, it makes me sick\") and David Hicks, the Adelaide man who was imprisoned for six years in Guantánamo Bay: \"I felt very strongly about this young guy who'd made a mistake and ended up in Guantánamo Bay.\"\n\nHe has never hesitated about speaking up for what he believes in, and he doesn't when it comes to Gaza. \"The Israelis cut off their water, electricity, food. So why are we surprised when children are starving to death? To behave that badly and for there to be this massive silence - it's just eerie. [Israel says] we have the right to defend ourselves. Do any of us have the right to obliterate an entire people? Obviously not.\"\n\nIt is a rare children's entertainer who will comment on politics; the parents tend to get wobbly about it, perhaps from fear the topic will worry their children - or from some underlying belief that children's entertainers are apolitical, asexual, unserious beings who have never held an adult thought. \"But I think I have an obligation to say something on Gaza,\" Combe says. \"You like to think that your values come through in your music - I hope people aren't surprised I feel the way I do. If they aren't, I am pleased.\"\n\nChildhood is a precious state; he dislikes anything, such as war, that makes kids grow up too fast. \"I think it's quite sad and unhealthy to not value childhood immensely. It's a wonderful part of your life,\" he says. \"I was lucky to have an incredibly good childhood and I've never stopped thanking my parents for that. It is the greatest gift you can give your children.\"\n\nWhat set his childhood apart, he thinks, was that he felt deeply loved - not just that he was loved, he stresses, but that he knew he was. \"And that's a big deal,\" he says.\n\nRelistening to Combe as an adult, it is striking how sophisticated his songs are. Take Newspaper Mama, which he wrote in 90 minutes: an 80s pop hit reminiscent of Huey Lewis or Peter Gabriel.\n\n\"I love the idea of introducing children to sophistication in music,\" he says. \"I'm a control freak in the studio because it should always be done well. If I get a string quartet, I want a really classy one. I want a terrific studio and a great engineer. I don't ever cut corners, because I think children don't deserve to have their corners cut.\"\n\nPeople often ask him if children are different to perform for in 2025 than they were when he started, he says. (I discretely cross this question off my pad.)\n\n\"And the answer is, not really,\" he says. \"The only real difference I've noticed is a subtle sense of surprise that I'm not on a screen. I'm not on an iPad or their phone - I'm actually there. And that's a revelation.\"\n\nThe kids have not changed, but the music industry has. Mr Clicketty Cane has been streamed more than 10m times on Spotify, though \"that gets you bugger all\", he snorts: \"The sales per play on Spotify are so minuscule, it is 0.00-something - it's nothing like CD sales were.\"\n\nBut Combe is all about the music; he still feels a thrill when he stands before a noisy, wriggling crowd, waiting to win over those 10- and 11-year-olds.\n\n\"Children are wonderful critics because they're very intolerant. They haven't learned being polite. If they don't like it, they'll talk, they'll get up,\" he says, then laughs. \"Adults will just sit there being bored!\"</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.14886125866273772,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Peter Combe\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"Children's entertainer\",\n    \"nationality\": \"AUS\",\n    \"quote\": \"Kids just wait for that line.

Hours before his death, Shalev, 30, had posted a message on social media saying he felt he could not go on.\n\n\"Please don't be angry with me, please,\" he wrote. \"No one will ever understand me, and that's OK because you can't understand. I just want this suffering to end. I'm alive, but inside everything is dead.\"\n\nMore than 370 revellers were killed when Hamas-led Palestinian militants crossed from Gaza into Israel in the early hours of 7 October 2023 and attacked the music festival and several nearby communities.\n\nShalev's girlfriend, Mapal Adam, and his best friend, Hili Solomon, were murdered before his eyes as the trio tried to hide under a car. Shalev was shot trying to save his girlfriend, according to Adam's sister, Maayan.\n\n\"Roei lay next to the dead love of his life for about two hours until the army arrived and rescued him,\" Maayan told Ynet last year. \"She was hit by a bullet that penetrated her ribs and went into her heart - I say her heart was so big that it was impossible to miss it.\"\n\nShalev's mother killed herself two week after the atrocities. According to Israeli media reports, she had been very close to Adam and was devastated by her death.\n\nMaayan Adam posted a picture of her sister and Shalev on Saturday. Its caption read: \"Roei was murdered on 7 October and died yesterday. I have no words and it will take time to find them. Hope these two kids are hugging and smiling right now, hearts pressed together again.\"\n\nThe Nova Tribe Community Foundation, which supports survivors of the attack and their families, described Shalev as \"a backbone of the community\" and urged that he be remembered for his bravery and kindness.\n\n\"We ask to remember him for his beautiful moments, his courageous support of the community, his work as captain of the Nova Tribe basketball team and his constant devotion to helping his friends, sons and daughters of the Tribe during their most difficult and challenging time,\" it said in a statement.\n\nSeveral secular opposition politicians - many of whom, unlike most ruling coalition members, remain active on social media during the Jewish sabbath - reacted with dismay to the news on Saturday and called for greater mental health support for survivors of the 7 October attacks.\n\nYair Golan, the head of the leftwing Democrats party, wrote: \"Roei could not withstand the pain, but others are still here fighting, coping, trying to live.

It has also emerged that he appears to have had Islamic marriages to three women in towns across the north of England at the same time, fathering two young children to one of them.\n\nThe 38-year-old, who cannot be identified, described how Shamie was \"controlling and manipulating\", admonishing her for drinking energy drinks, encouraging her to go to the mosque, read the Qur'an and pray with him, and later refusing her requests for a divorce.\n\nHowever, she said that he had never appeared radicalised and was a \"normal\" practising Muslim, adding that he had barely mentioned Israel's attack on Gaza - which counter-terror police are examining as a potential motive for his attack. One witness heard him shout: \"This is what you're going to get for killing our children\" as he tried to force his way into the synagogue armed with a knife last Thursday.\n\nShe said: \"Was he this terrorist all along or was he crying out for help? Who knows? Maybe [he did it because of] his messed-up life, because he's playing too many people. Apparently he was up for rape with the police. There's so many questions.\n\n\"Did he do it because he knew he was going to get found out about these other women and he was up [on police bail] for [rape]? Or was he just mentally fed up and drained because he couldn't carry on living the lifestyle?\"\n\nPolice said on Wednesday that Shamie pledged allegiance to Islamic State in a call to 999 during the attack but reiterated that he was not known to counter-terror officers. However, he is known to have a criminal past and was under investigation for an alleged rape.\n\nThe Guardian revealed this week that police officers attended his family home earlier this year, believed to be in relation to safeguarding concerns. He lived at the property in Prestwich, north Manchester, with his mother and one of his wives and their two children, aged one and three. After the police visit, he told neighbours that his wife had left and would not let him see their children.\n\nIn an hour-long interview on Wednesday, a separate wife described how Shamie had led a double life and initially kept his Manchester family secret. She said they met on the Muslim dating app Muzmatch (now called Muzz) in December 2021 and married in an Islamic ceremony the following month.\n\nShamie is said to have used multiple online personae, frequently using the name \"Jay\" and in one profile calling himself Dormammu Seven - a reference to a comic-book devil. His interests included anime and the Marvel series, working out, playing football, praying at the mosque and attending Islamic talks, she said, adding that he did not drink or take drugs.\n\nThe woman, a Muslim convert, said she last spoke to him in April this year, shortly after he passed his driving test. Speaking about their relationship, she described how he had been nice at first but then became \"controlling, manipulating\" and \"intimidating and aggressive\", adding: \"He would be slating me and my children and would say 'Who would want you and your baggage?'\"\n\nShe said Shamie had raped her multiple times but that she did not report this to police until after the synagogue attack. The woman said she had now given a first witness account and handed over her mobile phone to investigators.\n\nText messages seen by the Guardian show Shamie refusing her request for a divorce when she discovered he had children with another woman at his home in Manchester. In another he tells her: \"I can do better ... don't need someone with your baggage,\" and to \"stop being silly and paranoid\". He wrote: \"I've already taken u back as my wife u don't get to just dissappear [sic] and block me [it] doesn't work like that.\"\n\nIn a voice note, he said: \"I'm crazy about you. I can't stop thinking about you. You're the only woman I want in my life.\"</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.8398319750010843,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Jihad al-Shamie's first wife\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"intimidating, aggressive and controlling\",\n    \"message\": \"Jihad al-Shamie was intimidating, aggressive, and controlling.\"\n  -},\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Jihad al-Shamie's first wife\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"glued to his phone\",\n    \"message\": \"Jihad al-Shamie was constantly using his phone.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Jihad al-Shamie's first wife\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"living a lie with his religion\",\n    \"message\": \"Jihad al-Shamie was not genuinely committed to his religion.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Jihad al-Shamie's first wife\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"Throughout [their relationship] he hasn't talked about any of that\",\n    \"message\": \"Jihad al-Shamie never discussed extremist views during his relationship with his first wife.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Jihad al-Shamie's first wife\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"I wouldn't say he's got the mindset of being a terrorist from what I know of him - but at the same time how aggressive he was, how manipulating he was.\",\n    \"message\": \"Jihad al-Shamie did not seem to have the mindset of a terrorist, but he was very aggressive and manipulative.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Jihad al-Shamie's second wife (38-year-old)\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"controlling and manipulating\",\n    \"message\": \"Jihad al-Shamie was controlling and manipulating.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Jihad al-Shamie\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"SYR\",\n    \"quote\": \"This is what you're going to get for killing our children\",\n    \"message\": \"The attack is a consequence of killing children.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Jihad al-Shamie's second wife (38-year-old)\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"Was he this terrorist all along or was he crying out for help?

This has only made us more determined\n\nThis is the last article I will write before one of two things happens: my boat reaches Gaza, or Israel seizes it. We hope to arrive on 9 October, having been at sea since 27 September. Last week, Israel abducted the crew on the first Global Sumud flotilla the night before it had been due to land and deliver its aid. That is probably the same point that Israel will try to seize our Thousand Madleens and Freedom Flotilla Coalition boats, too.\n\nOur second flotilla has kept sailing amid all the news of what has happened to the first one. We were just off Cyprus, getting ready for a night watch overshadowed by a loud unidentified drone, when we heard Israel had illegally commandeered the two main Sumud boats in international waters. The following morning, I washed a pile of plastic bowls in the sink while checking my phone: one by one, Israel seized the rest of the flotilla.\n\nOn my boat, this news has only made us more determined. We have work to do: a ship to navigate through temperamental weather with seven people living in close quarters, and aid to deliver. Keeping up with the first flotilla has helped us establish what we might expect, but it has not dented our resolve to continue.\n\nAt this point of sailing, I've settled into a routine. I sleep from 11pm to 2am, get up for my night shift until 5am and then manage another two hours of sleep afterwards, bringing the total to five. More is impossible between the turbulent waves and the constant interruptions of communal living. My bed is a slim mattress above the couch in the common area; I get dressed inside my sleeping bag each morning while someone makes coffee at the kitchenette a metre away. There are aspects of living with six other people on a 40ft boat that take, to put it mildly, getting used to. You can't stay put anywhere for long without getting in someone else's way.\n\nBut we do all get along well. The common goal helps, as does our sailors' expertise: they know what they're doing, which creates an infectious calm.\n\nThe medicine and baby formula packed in the stern cabin and cockpit of our boat will save lives if Israel doesn't abduct us. \"I assume you see this mission as symbolic, since they'll certainly stop you,\" an interviewer said to me last week. Perhaps that's how it seems from far away. But when you've sailed for more than a week with aid all around you, knowing exactly where it's stored, it's impossible not to keep hoping you will reach those who need it.\n\nYet aid is not the ultimate point of the flotilla, nor the ultimate point of the Palestinian cause. Israel likes to ask why we don't \"just\" let them distribute our supplies. Besides there being good reason to distrust that this would actually happen when Israel has been deliberately starving Palestinians for two years, doing so would tacitly concede that Israel has the right to control Palestinian waters.\n\nFurther details of the Sumud flotilla emerged over the weekend: that the abductees had been trafficked to Ktzi'ot prison in the Negev desert. That they were being processed as illegal immigrants, despite having been forcibly transferred to Israel from international waters. That Israel was denying them water, medicine and food, with degrading and sometimes violent treatment at the hands of its officers. On Monday, it was reported that 341 activists had been deported, with 138 still in detention.\n\nThis is horrific - but nowhere near as bad as the abuses faced by Palestinians in the same prison. Thaer Abu Asab, 38, was allegedly beaten to death in 2023 after refusing to bow his head to guards; 19 officers were investigated and none charged. Human rights group B'Tselem has documented widespread torture and sexual violence in the detention centre. The international outrage we've seen over the treatment of flotilla participants is necessary and justified. But where was it for Palestinians in all those decades of barbaric Israeli conduct?\n\nI look across the endless blue sea each morning, and at the sinking amber moon before the next dawn's rise, and know that my boat's liberty to navigate such vastness reinforces the importance of not treating this mission as charity. Palestinians do not yet have freedom, and our own freedoms will be compromised until they do. That's why we're sailing. It's that simple.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.4626249833540483,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"an interviewer\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"interviewer\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"I assume you see this mission as symbolic, since they'll certainly stop you\",\n    \"message\": \"The mission, which involves a flotilla sailing to Gaza, is assumed to be symbolic by an interviewer, as they believe the Israeli authorities will certainly stop it before it reaches its destination.\"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP"}],"createTime":"2025-10-15T10:37:03.959221Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"T3nvaPXFOoaVmecPn42n2Ak","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":110,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":110}],"promptTokenCount":1348,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1348}],"thoughtsTokenCount":505,"totalTokenCount":1963,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}}}

This year, the committee has a total of 338 candidates to choose from (244 of which are individuals and 94 organisations).\n\nOther past winners include presidents, campaigners and organisations, from US President Jimmy Carter to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, from Nelson Mandela to the late Chinese rights activist Liu Xiaobo, from the EU to International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.\n\nNorwegian politicians have been steeling themselves for potential repercussions to US-Norway relations if it is not awarded to Donald Trump.\n\nThe Norwegian Nobel Committee pointedly said on Thursday that it had reached a decision about who would be named 2025 peace prize laureate on Monday, several days before Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire under the US president's Gaza plan.\n\nTaking into account the timeframe and the composition of the independent five-person committee, most Nobel experts and Norwegian observers believe it is highly unlikely that Trump will be awarded the prize, leading to fears in the country over how he will react to being overlooked so publicly.\n\nFollow us here for all the buildup, the announcement, and, of course, the reaction.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-8.653556187947592,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP"}],"createTime":"2025-10-15T10:37:03.893408Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"T3nvaODDNr2qmecP1b-B-Ac","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":6,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":6}],"promptTokenCount":772,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":772}],"thoughtsTokenCount":478,"totalTokenCount":1256,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}}}

A UN human rights report has deemed that Israel's actions in Gaza constitute a genocide.\n\nThe survivors have endured prolonged famine as a result of a deliberate Israeli policy of cutting off food supplies, and the Israel Defense Forces have made much of the Gaza Strip uninhabitable. According to a recent survey by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, about 70% of Gaza's buildings have sustained severe damage.\n\nThe statistics are shocking but impersonal. Through her photographs, Enas Tantesh has recorded what those crude numbers mean in intimate terms - what it looks like when your home and community are pulverised.\n\nBefore the war started, with a deadly Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, Tantesh had never considered being a photographer. She was finishing high school and following in the footsteps of her father, a locally celebrated and widely beloved swimming instructor, and had started to teach children in her home town of Beit Lahiya.\n\nHowever, as the Israeli bombardment took its toll and increasing numbers of Gaza's journalists either fled or were killed, her older sister Malak began writing for the Guardian and other European newspapers. Around the same time, in the spring of 2024, Enas started taking photographs of the turmoil and devastation around her, equipped only with a Samsung mobile phone and a few tips from her father.\n\nHer pictures taken over the next 18 months show an entire people reduced to nomads and scavengers on their own land.\n\nNine out of 10 people of Gaza have been forced to leave their homes because of bombardment or Israeli evacuation orders. Like almost every other Palestinian family, the Tanteshes have had to pack everything they could carry, travel across Gaza to cram into a relative's home, and then move again when that home came under fire, and then do so yet again.\n\nThe family have had to move 11 times, and in common with most people in Gaza they have ended up living in tents improvised out of bits of wood, cloth and plastic sheeting.\n\nTantesh's photos capture the impermanence, despair and constant insecurity of day-to-day life for a traumatised populace trudging through a ruined urban landscape. Following the direction of her eyes is a reminder that survival is not just about finding shelter and water and scraping just enough to eat. It is also about seeking out moments of normality and human connection whenever possible: eating with the family, children playing, or one of Gaza's cats somehow retaining its elegance, immaculately groomed and aloof amid all the wreckage.\n\nTantesh has faced suspicion and abuse while going about her work. Passersby sometimes wish death upon her, assuming she is one of an increasing number of people who shares images of other people's suffering online, without context or permission, to fuel their personal fundraising efforts.\n\nShe was once detained by Hamas while on the street working. She was questioned about her motives and credentials but was freed after a brief interrogation.\n\nIn the course of the war, Tantesh has developed a thick skin and a steady nerve. On one assignment, she photographed a man being operated on for a stomach wound that had become infected in one of Gaza's semi-wrecked hospitals. She was allowed into the cramped operating theatre on condition she would help pass surgical implements and swabs while the patient's abdomen was opened up.\n\nWhen a beachside cafe was shelled a block away from the temporary family home in Gaza City, Tantesh recorded the aftermath, taking pictures of what remained of its customers, too graphic to be published.\n\nLike all Palestinians in Gaza, Tantesh has become inured to death. \"It has become routine,\" she said. \"People see something terrible and just keep walking.\"\n\nEvidence has grown that Israel is targeting journalists in Gaza: 248 have been killed so far. Tantesh has learned to live with fear and how to mitigate risk, always keeping one eye on the sky for killer drones.\n\nThe most dangerous place she had worked, she said, was at Gaza port, where Israeli patrol boats would regularly strafe the shore with machine-gun fire.\n\nIn the apartment where the family stayed in Gaza City, one room facing the sea had a bullet hole in the wall. Tantesh's father would bar his children from going in there when there was shooting, but she would often tiptoe to take photos from its vantage point over the beach.\n\nEarlier in the year, the family returned to Beit Lahiya in the north and Tantesh's pictures recorded the bitter homecoming. She and her sister tried to find their family house amid the ruins but finally had to be guided there by a neighbour because each flattened street looked like the next.\n\nShe and her sister climbed one of the few multistorey structures still standing, braving Israeli snipers to get a view of the desolation.\n\n\"Those photographs of my own home were the hardest I ever had to take,\" Tantesh said.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.1567182697233607,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Enas Tantesh\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"Photographer\",\n    \"nationality\": \"PLE\",\n    \"quote\": \"It has become routine.

Sign up for the Weekly Beast media newsletter here\n\nAs a multicultural broadcaster, SBS is in the eye of the storm when it comes to international politics. Without a managing director after James Taylor resigned in August to take up the position of chief executive of outdoor advertising company oOh!media, the broadcaster is also grappling with two sensitive issues.\n\nSBS's decision last month not to follow the lead of a number of European broadcasters and boycott next year's Eurovision song contest if Israel is permitted to compete has infuriated many viewers.\n\nThe broadcaster has confirmed it had received audience feedback after media reports about its intention to take part.\n\n\"SBS recognises this is a time of deep concern to our audiences. We take all feedback seriously, and remain committed to providing comprehensive and trusted coverage of the conflict from diverse perspectives across our network,\" a spokesperson told Weekly Beast.\n\nAt Senate estimates, Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi joined SBS fans in expressing her dismay, peppering executives with questions.\n\n\"Israel is also set to attend and will perform pop songs, while the state of Israel bombs and buries Palestinian children under rubble,\" Faruqi said.\n\n\"If Israel participates, will Australia, because SBS is the broadcaster, will you also withdraw, or will you provide cover for Israel?\"\n\nThe acting managing director, Jane Palfreyman, said it was crucial in these \"troubling times\" to be impartial and not to state a position for or against. She said viewers had enjoyed Eurovision for 40 years and that was not going to change.\n\nFaruqi was also critical of SBS's reported editorial response to the Albanese government's recognition of Palestine. A report in Nine newspapers claimed staff are \"unable to use the word Palestine\".\n\nThe director of news and current affairs, Mandi Wicks, later issued a clarification, which said it \"is not correct to say that SBS journalists are not allowed to use the term Palestine\".\n\nWicks said SBS's guidance is now to refer to the \"Occupied Palestinian Territories, which Australia recognises as the State of Palestine\".\n\n\"This provides context for our audiences, and accurately reflects the recent developments,\" she told Weekly Beast. \"SBS is editorially independent from government, and our editorial guidance is continually evolving.\"\n\nThe ABC's guidance is that staff can refer to Palestine when referring to its geography, history, community and the intended state encompassing the Occupied Palestinian Territory, adding \"it is still correct to refer to the 'Occupied Palestinian Territory' and in some circumstances 'Occupied Palestinian Territory' is preferred as it more clearly communicates the actual current status of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem\".\n\nThe Guardian's style guide advises the use of Palestine to refer to the occupied West Bank and Gaza, but to avoid using the term Palestinian territories.\n\nOn Monday's Four Corners, the ABC's Americas editor, John Lyons, producer Elise Potaka and US journalists Emilie Gramenz and Phoebe Hosier investigate accusations that Donald Trump is profiting from the presidency.\n\nAudiences will get to see the story behind Lyons' questions to Trump about his business deals, which made headlines around the world.\n\n\"Your leader is coming over to see me very soon. I'm going to tell him about you,\" Trump warned Lyons.\n\nThe cancellation of an address by the Pulitzer prize-winning US journalist Chris Hedges at the National Press Club, 19 days after it was confirmed, has infuriated not just the former New York Times war correspondent himself but organisers of his tour, the Australian Friends of Palestine Association (Afopa).\n\nWeekly Beast spoke to Hedges after he published a furious post. He said it's a \"very common experience for those of us who are speaking about the genocide\" to be snubbed.\n\nDespite what the press club said, it was a firm invitation, he insisted. Having read the correspondence between Afopa and the club, we agree.\n\nOn 8 September the club sent an email that said Hedges was slated to speak on Monday 20 October, with the words: \"Our confirmation is attached\". His bio and photos were duly sent.\n\nOn 27 September a further email from the NPC chief executive, Maurice Reilly, headed \"URGENT Cancellation Chris Hedges address\" said that \"in the interest of balancing out our program we will withdraw our offer\".\n\nHedges, who had already written his NPC address which was to focus on the betrayal of Palestinian journalists, accused the club of \"caving to the Israel lobby\".\n\nHe also alleged the Israeli ambassador to Australia, Amir Maimon, \"is reportedly being considered to speak\".\n\nThe NPC said there were no plans for the ambassador to speak at the club.\n\nSo why was Hedges cancelled? Reilly said: \"We have had a review of our speaker program and our broadcast expectations. We are receiving an excess of proposals in favour for the Palestine cause which is understandable in the current environment.\"\n\nHe cited Chris Sidoti, Prof Ben Saul, judge Navi Pillay and James Elder from Unicef as speakers who fit in that category. He denied there had been any external pressure from sponsors or lobby groups.\n\nHedges, who will give the annual Edward Said memorial lecture on 18 October, will now give his NPC address at a Sydney event on 20 October, which will be livestreamed.\n\nSometimes it is hard to pick which question at Senate estimates is the most ridiculous, but a line of questioning from One Nation's Malcolm Roberts relating to an interview broadcast on ABC Radio in 1975 was a clear winner on Wednesday.\n\nRoberts started off earlier in the evening by asking the ABC's managing director, Hugh Marks, whether the ABC would \"keep pornography out of the hands of children\".\n\nBefore Marks could answer, Roberts was told by the committee chair, Senator Varun Ghosh, that his question should be directed to the eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, who was appearing later.\n\nRoberts returned to the forum later to ask a follow-up question to a matter raised by former Liberal senator Eric Abetz in 2018.\n\n\"Did the ABC in 1975 allow three self-confessed pederasts to be interviewed in the ABC Sydney studios and did the ABC ever report that to the New South Wales police?\n\n\"Did you say 1975?\" then MD David Anderson asked before taking the question on notice.\n\nAt the time the ABC told Abetz it had no records of the interview, but according to contemporary reports Lateline interviewed three \"self-confessed pederasts\" in 1975.\n\nNow Roberts wanted an \"assurance that the ABC will not use its platform to air material sympathetic to or supportive of paedophiles or pederasts ever again\".\n\nMarks said material that did not meet the ABC's editorial standards would not be broadcast.\n\nFormer ABC News Breakfast co-host Michael Rowland will join 7.30 in the newly created role of national affairs reporter next month.\n\nA former Washington correspondent, Rowland has had regular stints with the program as reporter and fill-in host and is a former business and economics correspondent for Lateline.\n\n\"Across more than 35 years in journalism, Michael has built a reputation for sharp insight, engaging storytelling and unflappable composure under pressure,\" 7.30 executive producer, Joel Tozer, told staff. \"His breadth of experience - spanning politics, economics and major global events - will be a tremendous asset to 7.30 as we continue to deliver impactful and agenda-setting reporting.\"</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.48445743168347755,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"SBS spokesperson\",\n    \"organisation\": \"SBS\",\n    \"role\": \"spokesperson\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"SBS recognises this is a time of deep concern to our audiences.

We still have a famine to fight and diseases are spreading, so we really need that scale-up to happen quickly and efficiently.\"\n\nIngram said Unicef was calling for all crossings from Israel into Gaza to be reopened, so that trucks are able to move through quickly \"without delays or impediments\".\n\nAnother UN aid agency, Unrwa, said it has enough stored food to feed every Palestinian in Gaza for three months. Its communications director, Juliette Touma, said on Saturday that the distribution of aid was \"absolutely critical in controlling the spread of famine\".\n\nTens of thousands of tonnes of supplies are positioned in neighbouring countries such as Jordan and Egypt. Under the terms of the first phase of the deal, aid is meant to surge into Gaza, and humanitarian groups are preparing to send in about 600 truckloads of food and medical supplies a day.\n\nDuring the war, Israel shut down entry and exit routes, largely blocking off food and medicine, which in turn caused a famine in large parts of Gaza.\n\nAid agencies are hoping Israel will now stick to Trump's 20-point plan, which said the entry and distribution of aid in the Gaza Strip should \"proceed without interference\".\n\nOn Saturday, the Italian defence minister said the Rafah crossing, a crucial movement point between Gaza and Egypt for aid trucks but also people, will reopen on Tuesday. Israel took control of the border post last year.\n\nRafah \"will be opened alternately in two directions: exit towards Egypt and entry towards Gaza\", Guido Crosetto said.\n\nWith the UN returning to a lead role in humanitarian assistance, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a US and Israeli-backed private contractor scheme, appeared to be winding down. The controversial programme was widely condemned, as it forced people towards food distribution sites where they were shot in large numbers by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). One UN official called it a \"sadistic death trap\".\n\nThe truce is hoped to halt the famine, see the release of hundreds of detained people and end daily Israeli bombings that often wiped out whole families. On Friday, tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians in Gaza began to return to the ruins of their homes after the Israeli troops withdrew to new, agreed-upon positions. According to Gaza's civil defence agency, more than 500,000 people have returned to Gaza City since the ceasefire.\n\nTrump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, was in Gaza early Saturday to observe the Israeli military redeployment, Israeli Army Radio reported, citing a security source.\n\nStill, there are concerns that the deal could break down unless pressure is kept up.\n\nPrevious ceasefires have failed, and an Israeli attack on Lebanon early on Saturday led to fears of fresh violence during a tense period. The pre-dawn airstrikes struck a building that sold construction vehicles, and killed one person and wounded seven others, the Lebanese health ministry said.\n\nIsrael's military claimed it struck a place where machinery was stored to be used to rebuild infrastructure for the militant group Hezbollah.\n\nThe US-led agreement reached this week aims to end the current war in stages, delaying big issues such as the disarmament of Hamas and a clause that commits Israel to \"not occupy\" Gaza.\n\nAccording to the agreement, Hamas is obliged to release all Israeli hostages from Gaza within 72 hours of the ceasefire starting, meaning Monday morning.

Habib had refused to sign the document.\n\nGuardian Australia understands the waiver required detainees to acknowledge they had sought to illegally break Israel's naval blockade on Gaza.\n\nIt was not known on Sunday if Habib signed the waiver before being released. Previously, at least one flotilla member who did not sign was nevertheless released, sources have said.\n\nHabib previously told Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Dfat) officials who visited that she had experienced \"degradation but no physical abuse\" in custody.\n\nHabib said she had been provided access to her lawyer but had eaten only \"stale bread\" and drank \"brown\" tap water.\n\nThe high-security prison in the Negev desert where she was held is known for its detention of Palestinian security prisoners- many of whom Israel accuses of involvement in militant or terrorist activities.\n\nA Dfat spokesperson earlier on Sunday said it had raised the treatment and welfare of Australians detained in Israel with Israeli officials in Tel Aviv and Canberra.\n\n\"We understand that people want to help deliver aid to those suffering in Gaza - we also want to see critical aid delivered,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"For some time, we have warned against attempts to breach the naval blockade and strongly advised Australians not to do so because of the risks to their safety. We repeat our call on Israel to enable the sustained, unimpeded flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza.\"\n\nHabib's ship, the Conscience, departed from Italy for Gaza in early October and reportedly carried about 100 volunteers, including medics and journalists, along with vital aid. It was intercepted days before the Donald Trump-brokered ceasefire deal was announced.\n\nThe Conscience was part of a flotilla comprising nine ships, all of which were intercepted in the early hours on Wednesday morning.\n\nOn Sunday, tens of thousands of Australians around the country marched at pro-Palestine demonstrations. In Sydney, the organisers suggested they would continue to march until aid organisations were let into Gaza and the strip was rebuilt.\n\nSurya McEwen, a passenger on the previously intercepted Sumud flotilla who arrived in Australia on Friday after being detained by Israel, said flotilla activists would continue to try to deliver aid by sea \"as long as there is a situation where there's a brutal and illegal blockade on Gaza\".\n\nGuardian Australia sought comment from the Israeli embassy in Australia and the Israeli government regarding Habib's detention and release.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-2.0891190786210316,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Madeleine Habib\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"Activist\",\n    \"nationality\": \"AUS\",\n    \"quote\": \"degradation but no physical abuse\",\n    \"message\": \"The speaker experienced degradation but no physical abuse during her time in custody.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Madeleine Habib\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"Activist\",\n    \"nationality\": \"AUS\",\n    \"quote\": \"stale bread\",\n    \"message\": \"The speaker reported that the food she was given to eat was stale bread.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Madeleine Habib\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"Activist\",\n    \"nationality\": \"AUS\",\n    \"quote\": \"brown\",\n    \"message\": \"The speaker reported that the tap water she was given to drink was brown.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"DFAT spokesperson\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade\",\n    \"role\": \"Spokesperson\",\n    \"nationality\": \"AUS\",\n    \"quote\": \"We understand that people want to help deliver aid to those suffering in Gaza - we also want to see critical aid delivered.

When the president is this volatile and authoritarian, of course we have to be prepared for anything,\" Bergstø told the Guardian.\n\n\"The Nobel Committee is an independent body and the Norwegian government has no involvement in determining the prizes. But I'm not sure Trump knows that. We have to be prepared for anything from him.\"\n\nTrump has long been outspoken about his belief that he should be awarded the peace prize, an honour previously bestowed upon one of his presidential predecessors, Barack Obama, in 2009 for his \"extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples\".\n\nIn July, Trump reportedly called Jens Stoltenberg, Norway's finance minister and the former Nato secretary general, to ask about the Nobel prize. At the United Nations last month Trump falsely claimed that he had ended seven \"unendable wars\", telling world leaders: \"Everyone says I should get the Nobel peace prize.\"\n\nArild Hermstad, leader of the Green party of Norway, said the Nobel committee's independence is what gives the prize its credibility.\n\n\"Peace prizes are earned through sustained commitment, not through social media tantrums and not from intimidation,\" he said. \"It's good that Trump supported the recent ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. Any step toward ending the suffering in Gaza is welcome. But one late contribution does not erase years of enabling violence and division.\"\n\nKristian Berg Harpviken, director of the Norwegian Nobel Institute, said the decision was finalised at the last meeting of the Nobel committee on Monday.\n\nHarpviken said that decisions are entirely apolitical, although the appointing of committee members by the Norwegian parliament in accordance with the will of Alfred Nobel, who bequeathed the money to fund the prizes that bear his name, may complicate that impression.\n\n\"I know first-hand the committee acts completely independently. But Alfred Nobel made it somewhat difficult for us by writing in his will that it must be appointed by the parliament. That, unfortunately, is non-negotiable,\" he said.\n\nNewspaper columnist and analyst Harald Stanghelle speculated that retribution from Trump - if it were to come - could take the form of tariffs, demands for higher Nato contributions or even declaring Norway an enemy.\n\n\"He [Trump] is so unpredictable. I don't want to use the word 'fear' but there is a feeling that it could be a challenging situation,\" he said. \"It's very very difficult to explain to Donald Trump or to many other countries in the world that it is a totally independent committee because they do not respect this kind of independence.\"\n\nHe said that if Trump were to win it, it would be the \"biggest surprise in the history of the Nobel peace prize.\"\n\nNina Græger, director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo (Prio), believes the most likely candidates to win this year's peace prize include Sudan's Emergency Response Rooms, the Committee to Protect Journalists and the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom.\n\n\"While he [Trump] clearly deserves credit for his efforts to end the war in Gaza, it is still too early to tell whether the peace proposal will be implemented and lead to lasting peace,\" said Græger.\n\n\"Trump's retreat from international institutions, and his wish to take over Greenland from The Kingdom of Denmark, a Nato ally, as well as infringements on basic democratic rights within his own country, do not align well with Nobel's will.\"</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.2600269969469725,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Kirsti Bergstø\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Socialist Left party\",\n    \"role\": \"leader and foreign policy spokesperson\",\n    \"nationality\": \"NOR\",\n    \"quote\": \"Donald Trump is taking the US in an extreme direction, attacking freedom of speech, having masked secret police kidnapping people in broad daylight and cracking down on institutions and the courts.

Members and trade union affiliates voted to back, first the findings of a UN commission of inquiry that Israel is committing genocide, and second that the government must do all it can to prevent it.\n\nIt is now two weeks since this motion was passed, but still the Labour government refuses to recognise the genocide in Gaza and allows the supply of weapons to Israel.\n\nOver the past 40 years in parliament, I have witnessed at first-hand the democratic deficit in our political system. For too long, top-down political parties have disempowered their membership and crushed internal debate. Now, Your Party will try to do something unprecedented in British politics: forge a mass, democratic party from scratch.\n\nWhen we launched, we announced that members would decide the policies, the strategy and even the name. In the meantime, we called it Your Party. It was an apt choice because it expressed the essence of what we are trying to build: a new kind of political party that belongs to its members.\n\nIn November, we are hosting our inaugural founding conference. This will be the moment that members come together to decide the direction of the party, the models of leadership, and the strategies we need to win. We want our conference to be participatory, open and democratic. Members will be chosen at random to come to the conference in person and debate our founding documents. Then, every member will get the final say online through one member, one vote.\n\nThis conference will not come out of the blue. It will be the product of a series of mass, regional assemblies up and down the country. More than just rallies, these assemblies will be an opportunity for communities to come together to discuss and debate the key questions facing the future of our party and our country.\n\nA democratic party isn't an end in itself. It will provide the space for people to organise, together, for a radically different society. When highly centralised political parties answer to nobody but themselves, you get policies that nobody asked for. You get privatisation of our public services. You get austerity. You get 4.5 million children living in poverty in one of the richest countries in the world. When political parties are democratically accountable to their members, you get policies that the British people want and need.\n\nI'll go further: undemocratic parties produce undemocratic societies, where a small section of society owns the resources we all need to survive. Democratic parties produce democratic societies; where wealth and resources are owned by us all. Take public ownership, for example. Currently, a small number of companies control the production of basic resources, to the detriment of us all. Everyone relies on these services, yet it is unaccountable shareholders who decide how they are run. Public ownership means giving communities the power to decide how to run the services they provide and consume. This is the heart of socialism: the extension of democracy into every sphere of life.

Those rights are in dire peril\n\nImagine a movement arising in this country that seeks to overthrow established power. Imagine that it begins with a series of rebellions, in Scotland and south Wales perhaps, that shut down workplaces, confront police and soldiers (sometimes peaceably, sometimes with crude weapons), set up roadblocks and lay siege to the places where fellow protesters are imprisoned and government officials are meeting.\n\nImagine that this movement goes on to smash or disable machinery across the country. Imagine that it organises a general strike, nixing much of the UK's economic activity for three months. Imagine that it keeps protesting in the same places by the same means, gradually eroding the resistance of the state.\n\nKeir Starmer's Labour government would doubtless do everything in its power not just to stop these individual actions but to prohibit the movement. What am I describing? The origins and development of the Labour party.\n\nThe Labour party arose from a long wave of protests by workers against capital, calling for workers' rights and for sweeping democratic reforms. These protests and their organisers came to be known as the labour movement. Its early actions included the radical war in Scotland, the Merthyr and Newport risings in south Wales, the Swing riots in England and the General Strike of 1842. No such protests would have meant no such movement. No such movement would have meant no such party.\n\nYet somehow, the party that arose from protest has formed, in terms of our rights to free expression and democratic challenge, the most illiberal government the UK has suffered since the second word war. This Labour government would have banned the labour movement.\n\nOver 40 years, starting with the Public Order Act 1986, our rights to assemble and challenge power have been severely curtailed. That act was followed by the Trade Union Act 1992, the Criminal Justice Act 1994, the Terrorism Act 2000, the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 and the Public Order Act 2023. Between them, they have largely bound and gagged effective protest.\n\nAny government that fails to contest and reverse this trend, even if it did nothing to add to this bleak legacy, sides with illiberalism. Far from doing so, Starmer's has already gone further than the Conservatives dared, by classifying a civil disobedience group - Palestine Action - as a terrorist organisation and banning it. It has also (so far with remarkably little resistance) inserted a clause into its crime and policing bill enabling the police to stop demonstrations \"in the vicinity of a place of worship\". As our towns and cities are so richly endowed with religious buildings, that means almost any urban area.\n\nBut its latest proposal is even worse. The home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has announced that the police should be able to stop protests that have a \"cumulative impact\", by recurring in the same place. She will also consider \"powers to ban protests outright\".\n\nMahmood has sought to justify these measures with the claim that repeated protests can leave religious groups, especially the Jewish community, feeling unsafe. It is worth noting that a Conservative home secretary, Suella Braverman, forced a very similar measure through parliament in 2023 (which was later struck down by the courts) using an entirely different argument: that repeated environmental protests were causing disruption to businesses and travellers. Illiberal people seek to stop protest. They will seize on any argument that justifies this urge.\n\nIt is essential that Jews in Britain are fiercely protected against antisemitic hate and antisemitic attacks. We must be perpetually vigilant against anyone who uses the Israeli government's genocide in Gaza as an excuse for antisemitism. This hate crime must be prosecuted, wherever it arises. But linking this disgusting crime to the act of protesting against the genocide, however peacefully and respectfully, as the government has explicitly done, triggers two grim thoughts.\n\nThe first is that it is using the horrific terrorism in Manchester last week as a good moment for shutting down dissent. The second is that it treats protests against Israeli government actions as protests against the Jewish community in Britain. Otherwise, it's hard to understand why Mahmood and the prime minister should have called for only one thing to be cancelled the following day to respect the grief of British Jews: not football matches, concerts, car boot sales and protests, but solely the silent and peaceful Palestine protest in London. Jewish people in this country have repeatedly warned against such conflations, which can themselves constitute antisemitism.\n\nMahmood's proposals, as well as being profoundly illiberal in their own right, add a new storey to the tower of authoritarian measures in whose shadow we live. We suffer the \"cumulative impact\" of a long succession of anti-protest laws. Labour is waging a concerted attack on the thing that made it.\n\nBut it's not like the 1830s, is it? Thanks to the protests of the past, we've overthrown the corrupt old elites and achieved democracy. Well, I hope one day our descendants will look back on our system and wonder how it could ever have passed for democracy, and why we tolerated it for so long.\n\nFirst-past-the-post elections delivering a massive majority on 34% of the vote? One second's participation in decision-making every five years? Presumed consent in between? Governments claiming to represent us, but responding instead to press barons and corporations? Politics on sale to the highest bidder, through political donations and paid lobbying? This is democracy? This is a system that requires no challenge?\n\nThose who opposed the labour movement two centuries ago also believed their political system was unimprovable. In 1830, when a tiny minority was allowed to vote and entire cities were unrepresented, the prime minister, the Duke of Wellington, told parliament that neither he nor the leader of the opposition could see any means by which \"the state of the representation could be improved\". The existing system deservedly \"possessed the full and entire confidence of the country\".\n\nOur political ancestors knew that to be effective you have to keep coming back. You have to turn up where it counts. You have to make a nuisance of yourself. You must be noisy, obstructive, annoying. One by one, all these rights have been struck down. Now the last remaining attribute of effective dissent - persistence - is also to be banned. Protest is allowed, as long as it's invisible, transient and useless. But the moment protest ceases to be effective is the moment democracy dies.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-3.1185515187131267,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Shabana Mahmood\",\n    \"organisation\": \"UK Government\",\n    \"role\": \"Home Secretary\",\n    \"nationality\": \"GBR\",\n    \"quote\": \"cumulative impact\",\n    \"message\": \"Police should be able to stop protests that repeatedly occur in the same location, as these are considered to have a significant, accumulating effect.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Shabana Mahmood\",\n    \"organisation\": \"UK Government\",\n    \"role\": \"Home Secretary\",\n    \"nationality\": \"GBR\",\n    \"quote\": \"powers to ban protests outright\",\n    \"message\": \"The complete prohibition of protests is being considered as a potential measure.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"The Duke of Wellington\",\n    \"organisation\": \"UK Government\",\n    \"role\": \"Prime Minister\",\n    \"nationality\": \"GBR\",\n    \"quote\": \"the state of the representation could be improved\",\n    \"message\": \"There were no identifiable methods by which the political representation system could be bettered, according to the Prime Minister and the leader of the opposition.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"The Duke of Wellington\",\n    \"organisation\": \"UK Government\",\n    \"role\": \"Prime Minister\",\n    \"nationality\": \"GBR\",\n    \"quote\": \"possessed the full and entire confidence of the country\",\n    \"message\": \"The existing political system rightfully held the complete trust and assurance of the nation.\"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP"}],"createTime":"2025-10-15T10:37:04.006084Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"UHnvaMQvuLqV3w_In8fxCQ","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":339,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":339}],"promptTokenCount":1778,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1778}],"thoughtsTokenCount":4284,"totalTokenCount":6401,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}}}

The organization also noted that the supreme court is expected to hear arguments on 23 October, \"after more than a year in which the state has been allowed to delay its response\".\n\nSince 7 October 2023, Israel has prevented international journalists from entering Gaza and reporting on the war, with the few allowed in under strict military supervision on guided tours arranged by the Israel Defense Forces.\n\nThe international media has relied on Palestinian journalists and media workers in Gaza, and contact with individual Palestinian civilians, aid agency staff and medical workers. But Palestinian journalists and media workers are the most at risk in the world, with 197 killed by Israeli attacks in the past two years, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ).\n\nAmong those most recently killed were Mariam Dagga, who worked for the Associated Press and Independent Arabia and was killed in an Israeli strike on Nasser hospital in Khan Younis on 25 August, and Reuters journalist Hussam al-Masri, who was killed in the same attack.\n\nIsrael carried out 25 targeted killings of journalists in that period, the CPJ said, describing them as murders.\n\nIsrael has consistently denied that it deliberately targeted journalists in its strikes, but its military has also acknowledged killing reporters, including Al Jazeera's Anas al-Sharif, who the IDF described, without evidence as \"the head of a terrorist cell\".\n\nA UN rapporteur on Friday said an Israeli attack in southern Lebanon on 13 October 2023 that killed Reuters journalist Issam Abdallah and wounded six others, including two AFP journalists, was a war crime. Morris Tidball-Binz, a UN special rapporteur, described it as \"a premeditated, targeted and double-tapped attack\" that violated international humanitarian law.\n\nThe FPA joined numerous international organizations that have demanded press access throughout the years of war. In July 2025, major news agencies including AFP, AP, BBC and Reuters released a joint statement emphasizing the importance of international media access for accurate reporting, and the July prior CPJ and more than 70 media and civil society organizations urged Israel to grant independent access to international journalists.\n\nIn February 2024, more than 30 news organizations, including the Guardian, signed a letter demanding protection for Gaza journalists.\n\nThis week, the Arab and Middle Eastern Journalists Assocation (AMEJA) posted a statement calling for Israel to release detained American reporter Emily Wilder, who had been on a flotilla for media workers called Conscience traveling into Gaza.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.8036315020392922,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Foreign Press Association\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Foreign Press Association\",\n    \"role\": null,\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"immediately open the borders and allow international media free and independent access to the Gaza Strip\",\n    \"message\": \"Israel should immediately open its borders and allow international media free and independent access to the Gaza Strip now that hostilities have ceased.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Foreign Press Association\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Foreign Press Association\",\n    \"role\": null,\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"after more than a year in which the state has been allowed to delay its response\",\n    \"message\": \"The supreme court is expected to hear arguments on October 23, after more than a year in which the Israeli state has been allowed to delay its response concerning access for international journalists to Gaza.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Israel Defense Forces\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Israel Defense Forces\",\n    \"role\": null,\n    \"nationality\": \"ISR\",\n    \"quote\": \"the head of a terrorist cell\",\n    \"message\": \"Al Jazeera's reporter Anas al-Sharif is the head of a terrorist cell.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Morris Tidball-Binz\",\n    \"organisation\": \"United Nations\",\n    \"role\": \"special rapporteur\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"a premeditated, targeted and double-tapped attack\",\n    \"message\": \"The Israeli attack in southern Lebanon on October 13, 2023, that killed Reuters journalist Issam Abdallah and wounded six others, including two AFP journalists, was a premeditated, targeted, and double-tapped attack that violated international humanitarian law.\"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP"}],"createTime":"2025-10-15T10:37:03.974267Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"T3nvaLu7O8Cam9IPy6SF0QQ","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":408,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":408}],"promptTokenCount":1017,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1017}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1672,"totalTokenCount":3097,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}}}

Qatari prime minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and head of Turkish intelligence Ibrahim Kalin also attended the Egyptian coastal resort to participate in the talks.\n\nThe presence of the senior officials from the three countries brought further hope that this round of talks could result in a deal, even as significant gaps remained between the two sides.\n\nTurkish foreign minister Hakan Fidan said on Wednesday that negotiations had made \"a lot of headway\" and that a ceasefire would be declared if they succeed.\n\nHamas has said that it is seeking international guarantees that Israel will not resume bombing Gaza after the group releases all the remaining hostages, living and dead, that it captured on 7 October 2023 - its main leverage over Israel.\n\nIn mid-March, Israel unilaterally ended a ceasefire when it resumed fighting in Gaza and declined to move to a second stage of talks which would have led to an end to the war.\n\nIn an interview with Egyptian TV on Wednesday, the leader of the Palestinian negotiating delegation and senior Hamas official Khalil al-Hayya said that the group needed firm guarantees from Trump that the war \"will not return\".\n\nThough Hamas has agreed to three parts of Trump's 20-point plan to end the war in Gaza - namely the release of all hostages in return for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, surrendering power in the strip and Israel's withdrawal from Gaza - the rest of the deal still needs to be discussed.\n\nAmong the points that still need to be negotiated are the demands that Hamas disarm, how and when Israeli troops withdraw from the Gaza Strip, and the makeup of an international technocratic body that is meant to govern Gaza.\n\nLogistics of a hostage-prisoner swap still need to be ironed out. Hamas had given mediators a list of Palestinian prisoners it wants to see released from Israeli prisons, said Taher al-Nounou, a senior Hamas official.\n\nRightwing members of the Israeli government have put pressure on prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu not to allow the release of certain prisoners, such as Marwan Barghouti, who has frequently been touted as a future Palestinian political leader, according to Israeli media.\n\nFar-right minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said that Netanyahu should seek \"complete victory\" over Hamas in Gaza, in remarks he made while praying at al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem - a disputed area that contains Islam's third-holiest site and is Judaism's holiest place - on Wednesday. Hamas called his visit a \"deliberate provocation\".\n\nJoining the talks are militant groups allied to Hamas including the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which holds some Israeli hostages as Hamas tries to present a unified Palestinian front.\n\nBoth Israel and Hamas have said that they are committed to making sure talks succeed. Netanyahu's office said on Tuesday that Israel was \"cautiously optimistic\" about the discussions. Hamas has also said it will operate in good faith to ensure talks result in a permanent ceasefire.\n\nIn separate statements, however, both parties have given conflicting visions on how they see the long-term prospects of the ceasefire. Netanyahu has said on two occasions that the Israeli army will remain in Gaza, in apparent contradiction to the Trump plan.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Hamas did not mention disarmament, while in interviews with Arabic media, some officials have rejected the idea of laying down the group's arms entirely.\n\nThe Trump administration and its Arab allies, as well as regional players such as Turkey, have thrown their weight behind the current round of peace talks in an effort to quickly push through a truce that has evaded negotiators for two years. Trump has said that he wants Israeli hostages to be released this week and has threatened Hamas with \"total obliteration\" if it does not agree to the deal.\n\nTrump's plan calls for an immediate end to fighting in Gaza, the release of all 48 hostages held by Hamas - 20 of whom are believed to still be alive - the disarmament of Hamas and its relinquishing of governing power in the Gaza Strip to an international transitional authority headed by Trump. In return, Israel would gradually withdraw to a buffer zone at the edges of the Strip and return nearly 2,000 Palestinian detainees.\n\nHumanitarian aid would also surge in a bid to alleviate the famine that consumes parts of Gaza as a result of Israel's blockade, as well as reconstruction funds to the destroyed Strip.\n\nIn conjunction with the talks in Egypt, US secretary of state Marco Rubio is set to attend a ministerial meeting in Paris with his counterparts involved in the peace process to discuss the day after in Gaza, according to Reuters.\n\nThe meeting will discuss the potential international stabilisation force in Gaza, the international body meant to rule over the territory, the disarmament of Hamas, as well as humanitarian aid and reconstruction, the Associated Press reported.\n\nIsraeli foreign minister Gideon Saar criticised the ministerial meeting for not including the country, describing it as being \"concocted behind Israel's back\". Saar said that he hoped the meeting would not jeopardise the release of hostages.\n\nIsrael continued to strike Gaza as negotiations progressed, despite the US calling for a ceasefire on Friday. At least 10 people were killed by Israeli strikes and fire over the last 24 hours, according to the Gaza health authority.\n\nAt least 67,183 Palestinians were killed and nearly 170,000 wounded by Israel's military campaign in Gaza over the last two years. Israel launched its war in Gaza after Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostage on 7 October 2023.\n\nA growing number of bodies, including the UN commission of inquiry, have concluded that Israel has committed genocide in its two-year war in Gaza. Israel denies the claim, saying it has only acted in self-defence.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.8268764685853687,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Hakan Fidan\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Government of Turkey\",\n    \"role\": \"Foreign Minister\",\n    \"nationality\": \"TUR\",\n    \"quote\": \"a lot of headway\",\n    \"message\": \"The ongoing peace negotiations have made significant progress.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Khalil al-Hayya\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Hamas\",\n    \"role\": \"Leader of the Palestinian negotiating delegation; Senior Hamas official\",\n    \"nationality\": \"PLE\",\n    \"quote\": \"will not return\",\n    \"message\": \"The conflict in Gaza will not resume.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Itamar Ben-Gvir\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Government of Israel\",\n    \"role\": \"Far-right Minister\",\n    \"nationality\": \"ISR\",\n    \"quote\": \"complete victory\",\n    \"message\": \"The Israeli Prime Minister should aim for a total win over Hamas in Gaza.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Hamas\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Hamas\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"PLE\",\n    \"quote\": \"deliberate provocation\",\n    \"message\": \"The Israeli minister's visit to the mosque was an intentional act designed to provoke a reaction.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Office of Benjamin Netanyahu\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Government of Israel\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"ISR\",\n    \"quote\": \"cautiously optimistic\",\n    \"message\": \"Israel is moderately hopeful about the ongoing peace discussions.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Donald Trump\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"total obliteration\",\n    \"message\": \"Hamas faces complete destruction if it does not agree to the proposed deal.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Gideon Saar\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Israel\",\n    \"role\": \"Foreign Minister\",\n    \"nationality\": \"ISR\",\n    \"quote\": \"concocted behind Israel's back\",\n    \"message\": \"The ministerial meeting was secretly planned without Israel's knowledge or involvement.\"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP"}],"createTime":"2025-10-15T10:37:03.990815Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"T3nvaN-8POiAm9IP78e4iQY","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":522,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":522}],"promptTokenCount":1721,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1721}],"thoughtsTokenCount":3381,"totalTokenCount":5624,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}}}

Zack Polanski will never do that\n\nThere is little doubt that Zack Polanski has had a good few first weeks as leader of the Greens. We know this because of a plethora of similarly-worded tweets on social media over the weekend waxing lyrical about Polanski being a \"breath of fresh air\", a leader who will \"tell it like it is\", who doesn't equivocate or use ambiguous language. And isn't that exactly what we want in our political leaders? Isn't that what is missing from the leadership of the main parties?\n\nThat's the approved line, anyway. It's almost as if the party has a disciplined and effective social media strategy. However, whereas Polanski is a decent media performer (and we shall return in due course to the reasons why he's seen as such), his deputy might be categorised under the heading of Not So Much.\n\nNot because Mothin Ali is a devout Muslim, for we already know that that has not prevented most of the other parties from producing formidable legislators and orators who share that faith. Ali is a vulnerability for Polanski's leadership because of his extreme views and because, despite those views, Polanski has expressed full support for him.\n\nIn a video that is no longer publicly available, Ali appeared to justify the pogrom by Hamas terrorists of Jews in southern Israel on October 7, 2023, and speculated that Israel would use the \"pretext of the fightback by Hamas fighters, or supposedly Hamas fighters\" to launch an attack on Gaza. A day later he took to Facebook to suggest that those who condemned the murder, torture and rape that Hamas perpetrated - as well as the kidnapping of 250 survivors - were guilty of \"white supremacy\".\n\nBut Ali will survive as his party's elected deputy because, as well as being acceptable to his leader, these views are entirely shared by most of the Greens' middle-class, keffiyeh-wearing membership. Whether such views will raise an eyebrow with the wider electorate is another matter, and Polanski might be advised to reduce the number of opportunities that the media have to quiz his deputy.\n\nThe Greens' annual conference has just wound up and many activists are excitedly taking to their keyboards to boast about some of the radical measures that delegates approved for the party's next election manifesto. It is generally recognised that, following the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the Soviet Union a couple of years later, Britain's disconsolate Marxists looked around for a new political home in which to indulge their ambitions, and settled on the nascent Green Party. It was a wise choice and their efforts have now borne fruit.\n\nThis year's conference approved a series of madcap policies, the most entertaining of which was the abolition of landlords (answers on a postcard, please). But there were others, including \"trans healthcare\", an \"anti-racism framework\", the proscription of the Israeli Defence Force (IDF) and opposition to President Trump's peace plan for the Middle East. This latter one is particularly notable since Green members are very keen to describe the conflict in Gaza as a genocide perpetrated by Israel. But just because there's a genocide doesn't necessarily mean they want it to end.\n\nIt's like looking through a dimensional portal to see how the Labour Party would look today if Jeremy Corbyn had remained as party leader and all his deepest, most treasured policies had been adopted by (Palestinian) flag-waving delegates.\n\nIn fact it's the demented nature of the Greens' policy positions that makes life easier, not more difficult, for the party leader. Realistic, pragmatic policies that try to take account of political and economic realities are difficult to develop and promote. They're not what a generation of activists raised on the principle of instant gratification want to hear. Having to cut the nation's coat according to its cloth is not something your average impatient Green activist will give any headspace to.\n\nSuch an unserious party with no hope of reaching government is easy to defend. Were Polanski about to seize power, he would face some serious scrutiny and have to come up with some uncomfortable answers. That, after all, is the essence of courageous political leadership - to tell an audience what they don't want to hear. Polanski will never have to do that, which is just as well, since his members would never put up with it.\n\nSo he can keep spouting his slogans and his sixth form-level \"solutions\", not because he is an intellectual and political powerhouse with the charisma of Winston Churchill, but because he has nothing to lose. And so long as the Greens occupy only a tiny number of Commons seats, the media will probably indulge or even overlook the obnoxious views held by their deputy leader.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-3.012848734204235,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Mothin Ali\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Green Party\",\n    \"role\": \"Deputy Leader\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"pretext of the fightback by Hamas fighters, or supposedly Hamas fighters\",\n    \"message\": \"Israel would use the actions described as the fightback by Hamas fighters, or supposedly Hamas fighters' actions, as a justification to launch an attack on Gaza.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Mothin Ali\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Green Party\",\n    \"role\": \"Deputy Leader\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"white supremacy\",\n    \"message\": \"Those individuals who condemned the murder, torture, rape, and kidnapping perpetrated by Hamas were guilty of white supremacy.\"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP"}],"createTime":"2025-10-15T10:37:03.959821Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"T3nvaM3KOoaVmecPn42n2Ak","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":183,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":183}],"promptTokenCount":1393,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1393}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1836,"totalTokenCount":3412,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}}}

What do you think should be common knowledge but isn't?\n\nThat every life is equal value to each other. And I think people forget that, and that's why atrocities like Gaza are allowed to happen.\n\nPart of your show is a love letter to your new home of Ireland. Who is your favourite Irish person?\n\nLiving or dead ... Sinéad [O'Connor]. I loved Sinéad. I thought she was an unbelievable artist and truth teller in a world that wasn't ready for it yet. I've read all of her stuff that she ever wrote, and all of her lyrics. I have tremendous empathy and sympathy for her and how she lived - and sadly died so soon.\n\nWhat is the weirdest thing that has happened to you on stage?\n\nMeat Loaf french-kissed me [on The Rosie O'Donnell Show]. Well, we were doing that song [Paradise by the Dashboard Light] and he put me in a dip, and then he kissed me with his tongue. I was like, what the hell is going on? And it was live TV, so I didn't quite know what to do. So I looked up and I was like, \"OK! Uh, Meat Loaf ... We'll be back right after this!\"\n\nIt was just something. And then his mother wrote me and said, \"You can't be mean to my son. He's a lovely man, and you embarrassed him.\" I'm like, well, I'm sorry that I didn't want to be french-kissed by him without warning.\n\nYou recently appeared in And Just Like That as a lesbian nun who comes to New York and then romances Miranda with every New York cliche under the sun. In that spirit ... what is the most embarrassing thing you have done for love?\n\nOh, boy. Mostly ... waited around. Waited around until it felt possible, you know. And I think that is romantic: to know something and then to wait until it's right. I don't do grandiose gestures, like flying somebody to Italy for dinner. That seems romantic, although exhausting. It takes patience and understanding and forgiving - a lot of forgiving, and forgiving yourself! - to be able to stand truly naked and vulnerable and honest beside the person that you love.\n\nWhat is the strangest job you've ever had?\n\nI worked at the Sears store in the catalogue department. So people would come in and ask for the things they ordered and I would go back into the bins and find it. Often, I was left to tell them that although they only kept one shirt [and returned the rest], they needed to pay the full shipping, because the cost of shipping one shirt is different than shipping five. They would say, \"Well, I'm not paying that\", so I would end up giving money from my pocket. Like, \"Alright, here's your $3, thank you.\"\n\nI ended up losing money at the job. I'm a bleeding heart. Everyone says I'm so tough. I'm like, if you only knew ...\n\nThe manager found out and he thought it was so nice of me that he said, \"We're going to make sure you don't have to deal with customers. We'll just have you in the back doing the bins.\"\n\nWhat has been your most memorable interaction with a fan?\n\nThe people who see me and start to cry. I always understand, because that's how I felt about Barbra Streisand - not that I'm equating myself to her at all - because, believe me, I'm not and I never will. But my reaction to her is similar to their reaction to me, and I always try to be overly present and deliver for them in some way.\n\nHow often do people cry?\n\nNot a lot, but more than you would think. Sometimes I'll be in the supermarket with my kid and I just see somebody stop and then their eyes fill up. And I go, here we go. They say, \"Are you Rosie?\" I say, \"I certainly am.\" They say, \"I knew it was you. I just can't! I can't believe this is happening!\"\n\n[I'm like], \"What can I do for you? What can I tell you? Do you have a question? What do you want to know?\" And they just keep crying. They cry more, and then they apologise for crying, and then I tell them \"don't be silly\", and they try to take a picture, and they're so discombobulated they can't get the picture, right? But it's a beautiful human connection.\n\nIf you could change the size of any animal to keep as a pet, what would it be?\n\nI'm gonna say kangaroo, because they're so adorable - until I saw the one that looks like a prize fighter. Like Arnold Schwarzenegger meets Mike Tyson. It looked like the scariest man on steroids from the gym. And then I saw a thing where it kicked someone and the person flew back like 40 feet. It felt terribly scary - and I thought, if [only] they were cute and little.\n\nI love squirrels too. I had pet squirrels. I hand-fed them; they came right to me. They would jump on me, climb on me and I would put them on my TikTok. And people would be like, \"You're going to get bit!\" First of all, they don't carry rabies, and second of all, they don't bite humans on the whole unless there's something wrong with them. I could tell their personalities.\n\nWhen you get to a hotel, what's the first thing you do?\n\nMake sure the lock works. I have a friend who never locks the door at a hotel. I'm like, \"Do you understand everyone has a pass key? If you don't put the lock on it, anyone could come in and murder you in the middle of the night.\" She's like, \"No one's gonna murder me.\" Oh my god - to live like that! I believe in a good, sturdy lock. And use it - frequently.\n\nWhat film do you always return to and why?\n\nThe Sound of Music. Fighting fascism, with songs interspersed, climbing over those mountains; the nuns saying, \"Reverend Mother, I have sinned\", and having the carburettors.\n\nI was on a show [this week] called Have You Been Paying Attention? And while they were talking about The Sound of Music, somebody said, \"Kurt, who was the bad Nazi guy ... \" I'm like, \"Kurt is one of the children! That was Ralph! Get your Sound of Music facts right, sir! How dare you!\"\n\nIt's my favourite movie of all time. If I see it on, I stop and I watch every single thing. And I think it's the most beautiful performance by both Christopher Plummer and the amazing Julie Andrews. I can't have people attacking my Julie Andrews.\n\nWhat is the oldest thing you have and why do you still have it?\n\nA piece of jewellery my mother gave to me when she was in the hospital, sick, and I never took it out of the box. It's a little pretend ring for a little girl. I look at it sometimes and I go, well, it's the memory of one of the last times I saw my mother.\n\nI also have this toy that I got for my 10th birthday, which is interesting: that's when my mum died. [The gift was] from Paula Mattarella, who was in my class in third or fourth grade. I see it in my apartment in New York and I'm like, I can't believe I still have that toy. It was a little gummy sculpture-like, but it moved or wiggled a little bit, like a bobble head. It had two plastic eyes and it's a rabbit.

She's front and center for the cold open, playing Attorney General Pam Bondi, testifying before the Senate judiciary committee. Bondi is combative from the start: \"My name is Pam Bondi, I spell it with an I because I ain't gonna answer any of your questions.\"\n\nShe busts out her burn book to hurl personal insults at the senators (\"Amy Klobuchar, your ass out here sounding like a Pokémon\") while doing everything she can to avoid answering questions about Trump's various scandals.\n\nShe brings out fellow mean girl cabinet member Kristi Noem (Tina Fey, sporting fake cosmetic surgery that is indistinguishable from the work Noem has had done), who dismisses the fact that the current government shutdown is Republican's fault: \"That makes me laugh more than the end of Old Yeller!\"\n\nYou knew that with Poehler hosting, Fey was bound to show up. Pairing them off as Bondi and Noem was the obvious and right choice, with Fey's caricature being particularly on point.\n\nDuring her monologue, Poehler celebrates her new podcast (\"I'm a podcaster now and if that's not a recession indicator I don't know what is\") and notes that tonight's episode marks 50years to the day that the first episode of Saturday Night Live aired.\n\nThe Rudemans is a sitcom about a super stand-offish, sarcastic family who all \"talk like they're a cashier at Buffalo Exchange\". There's not much here beyond that initial setup and a couple cheap pratfalls.\n\nThis is followed by a commercial for Non-Non-Alcoholic Beer, \"the first non-alcoholic beverage that's over 96% alcohol\", allowing drinkers to get wasted while still reaping the social benefits of sobriety (at least until a cop tries to administer a breathalyzer test).\n\nNext, Poehler is Miss Lycus, the Fast Psychic. With a \"hard out at 7\", the clairvoyant talk show host rushes through desperate people's questions as quickly and brutally as possible (most of her answers being some variation of \"He's dead\" and \"Drowned\"). This is Poehler's absurdist bread and butter, and the rare case where the rushed nature of a sketch is a plus.\n\nTelevision audiences' latest soapy obsession, The Hunting Wives - the \"straight but lesbian, horny Republican murder drama\" - is back for its second (rushed) season, featuring lots of thigh-squeezing, gun drawing, and \"more, you know, 'great' writing'\". This season also introduces a new character, played by Poehler's Parks and Rec costar Aubrey Plaza. Even with the guest stars, this sketch manages to give most of the female cast a chance to bounce off one another.\n\nThen, Poehler plays a pregnant corporate manager continuing to work up to and through her due date. Her water breaks during a meeting, but rather than going to the hospital, she jumps into a birthing pool in the middle of the office and, with the help of her crunchy hippie doula and supportive husband, births a fully grown businessman. A funny idea, but it feels rushed (in a bad way this time).\n\nMusical guest Role Model takes the stage for their first song. A surprise walk-on and quick shimmy from Charli xcx pops the audience. Then its time for Weekend Update, where Colin Jost celebrates the ceasefire agreement in the Middle East while also lamenting the federal invasion of Chicago: \"Only Trump could Freaky Friday Chicago and Gaza.\"\n\nMichael Che introduces the segment's first guest, Rhonda LaCenzo (Sarah Sherman), a panicky New Yorker outraged over the likelihood of Zohran Mamdani becoming the city's next mayor. Apoplectically claiming he's a \"hipster jihadist\" and \"an Isis-trained millennial nepo baby from Uganda\", while also admitting to having detailed sexual fantasies about the \"Bolshevik Tik Toker\", it turns out she's from Long Island and can't even vote in the election. It's a funny (and only slightly exaggerated) sendup of Big Apple Islamophobia, yet one can't help but find it odd that, in light of the next (presumed) administration, SNL choose to lay off cast member Emil Wakim over the summer, given he was the only guy they had who could have played Mamdani.\n\nLater, Jost welcomes popular returning guests Grant (Marcello Hernández) and Melissa (Jane Wickline), the couple you can't believe are together. The loud, dumb bro and shy, nerdy wallflower talk about their shared love of fall (\"the time when the trees lose their hair\"), their respective Halloween costumes of Mike Wazowski and Sylvia Plath (\"because it's the one day you can dress like a slut\"), and annual sexcapades (\"I take him into the bedroom, light my candle, and jackle on his lantern\").\n\nThen, Poehler crashes her old stomping grounds to challenge Jost and Che to an old-fashioned joke-off, evening the odds by bringing on both of her former Update co-hosts (\"my first wife and second wife\") Fey and Seth Meyers. A great treat for fans of Update, and an appropriately-star studded moment for the golden anniversary.\n\nDuring paid advertisement for their law firm, attorneys Billson & Lieberman promote their \"combined 50 years of legal experience\". They are suddenly interrupted by Lachlan Mulchburger, a \"jacked and old as hell\" rival lawyer who literally bursts through the wall like the Kool-Aid Man to announce that he has even more years of legal experience under his belt. Almost as soon as he appears, he's interrupted by elderly triplet attorneys who are even older and more experienced. The game of senior one-upmanship continues via Billson & Lieberman clones (whose synced up line delivery makes for the best gag of the night), a law practicing Dracula, and an ancient talking tree named Yggdrasil who once represented Zeus.\n\nNext, Poehler plays a wife and mother going through menopausal mid-life crisis by dressing and acting like an angry goth teenager. Her emotional outburst over her \"twisted reality\" - \"Raising two kids, taking care of my gaining parents ... vision blurry, nerve pinched, pelvic floor on the ground...F my life!\" - is vintage Poehler, although everything else about this one is forgettable.\n\nThe night's final sketch takes place during a masterclass at Juilliard, where a successful composer duo (Poehler and Bowen Yang) discusses the process behind their haunting instrumental themes for several acclaimed television dramas (including Severance and The Gilded Age). To the confusion of the students, their first drafts are all hokey rap songs a la Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, which feature wildly inaccurate lyrics about the plot of the shows. This is a much less funny version of the classic Roundball Rock sketch from 2013.\n\nDespite going out on a flat note, this was still a good episode, with expectedly strong hosting from Poehler and a number of fun cameos. On the one hand, this would have made for a much better season premiere, but on the other, it was the right choice to hand this historic episode over to a sure hand.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.6479256642211831,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Pam Bondi\",\n    \"organisation\":

Palestinians are desperate for an end to starvation and airstrikes. Israelis want the war to end for the sake of remaining hostages and soldiers. Violence has reverberated across the region. Momentum has been growing around Donald Trump's proposal, with both Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas grudgingly indicating acceptance under US threat.\n\nWith indirect talks between Israel and Hamas beginning in Egypt on Monday afternoon, there are frail hopes of progress at last. Yet both parties have made it clear that they reject major parts of the 20-point US plan, which begins with an immediate ceasefire, the return of all hostages - followed by the release of Palestinian prisoners - and the resumption of full aid.\n\nFor Netanyahu, perpetual war in Gaza and beyond extends his political survival. His far-right coalition partners want to expel Palestinians and settle Gaza. Hamas has no desire to sign itself out of existence, and handing back the last hostages would remove any leverage it retains. It has seen much of its leadership destroyed, as well as life in Gaza - but has also watched international public opinion shift unprecedentedly towards support for Palestinians, pulling governments in its wake. It can recruit from a huge pool of angry and traumatised young men.\n\nThe full peace plan is still more contentious. Pledges of broad support from governments in the region and in Europe do not mean that they think it feasible - still less that they want to commit troops to an \"international stabilisation force\". But some hope that a more plausible and just way forward might somehow emerge from all this.\n\nTrue, this proposal is less grotesque than the initial Trumpian vision of a \"riviera\" built on the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians. Palestinians would remain, but would be sidelined, as they were in drawing up the plan. The \"board of peace\" overseeing Gaza appears to be a colonial administration headed by Mr Trump himself and, disturbingly given his history in the region, Tony Blair.\n\nThe plan pays lip service to eventual self-determination and statehood as a mere \"aspiration\" - not a right - of the Palestinian people, via a path that could not be more vague, conditional or tentative. It states that Israel will not occupy or annex Gaza. Mr Netanyahu has already said that the military would stay in most of it and would \"forcibly resist\" a Palestinian state.\n\nMr Trump has strong-armed the Israeli prime minister at last, but deadly strikes continue and he, like Joe Biden before him, could have halted the slaughter long ago. Telling the two parties to \"move fast\" now reflects his short attention span as much as the pressing need for peace. He will surely settle for whatever allows him to claim credit. If Israel does stop, it could resume the offensive at any time - just as it broke the ceasefire early this year.\n\nAny opportunity to end this war of annihilation must be seized. Something better may emerge from this path, if - a huge if - Mr Trump and others apply heavy, sustained pressure to Mr Netanyahu and forge a deal that Arab nations can fully support, ensuring pressure on Hamas. But lasting peace should not and cannot be built upon an abandonment of basic Palestinian rights.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-3.1931267027642316,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Benjamin Netanyahu\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Government of Israel\",\n    \"role\": \"Prime Minister\",\n    \"nationality\": \"ISR\",\n    \"quote\": \"forcibly resist\",\n    \"message\": \"The Israeli military will use force to oppose the establishment of a Palestinian state.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Donald Trump\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"Former President of the United States\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"move fast\",\n    \"message\": \"The speaker is urging the two negotiating parties, Israel and Hamas, to accelerate their peace negotiations.\"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP"}],"createTime":"2025-10-15T10:37:04.102122Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"UHnvaOqdBpKYmecP2pef6QY","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":157,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":157}],"promptTokenCount":1121,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1121}],"thoughtsTokenCount":2278,"totalTokenCount":3556,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}}}

I mourn these lives and pray for the safe return of every hostage still held and for every family whose lives were torn apart by these atrocities,\" Mamdani said in the statement on Tuesday.\n\nHe denounced Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his government for launching a \"genocidal war\" in Gaza as well. He also accused the US government of being \"complicit\".\n\n\"A death toll that now far exceeds 67,000; with the Israeli military bombing homes, hospitals, and schools into rubble,\" Mamdani wrote. \"Every day in Gaza has become a place where grief itself has run out of language. I mourn these lives and pray for the families that have been shattered.\"\n\nHe said the last two years had \"demonstrated the very worst of humanity\" and called for an end to Israeli \"occupation and apartheid\".\n\nMamdani's statement prompted a sharp rebuke from the Israeli foreign ministry on X, accusing him of \"acting as a mouthpiece for Hamas propaganda\" and \"spreading Hamas's fake genocide campaign\".\n\n\"By repeating Hamas's lies, he excuses terror and normalizes antisemitism. He stands with Jews only when they are dead. Shameful,\" the post said.\n\nIsrael stands widely accused of committing genocide in Gaza, where its ongoing military assault has killed tens of thousands of civilians, some 20,000 of them children, caused famine and mass starvation, and razed much of the Palestinian territory. Netanyahu and his former defense minister Yoav Gallant are wanted by the international criminal court for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.\n\nMamdani is no stranger to criticism for his views on the Israeli government and its war in Gaza, and the issue has proved a major flashpoint in the mayoral race.\n\nHe has won significant support from certain segments of the Jewish community particularly among younger and more progressive voters, and faces stronger opposition from more conservative groups. A recent Marist poll found 35% of Jewish voters supported Mamdani, as does the same proportion supporting Cuomo. (The poll was taken before Eric Adams dropped out of the race.)\n\nThe democratic socialist has faced criticism over his past refusal to condemn the phrase \"globalize the intifada\", which some view as a call to violence. He has since said he would discourage use of the phrase. He also recently reiterated his intention to order the NYPD to arrest Netanyahu should he travel to New York.\n\nHis October 7 statement on Tuesday attracted pushback from other pro-Israel voices. David Frum, a writer at the Atlantic and former speechwriter for George W Bush, wrote on X: \"The chilly formulaic language about the 10/7 atrocity ... the intense angry passion of the denunciation of Israel's self-defense ... together they arrestingly reveal what the author cares about and what/who he does not care about.\"\n\nFox News anchor David Asman called the statement \"obscene\". He wrote on X: \"The 'very worst of mankind' is what Mamdani supporters are on the streets today celebrating...'honoring' the beasts responsible for Oct 7. He supports a 'global intifada,' responsible for 9/11 and Oct 7. He should not be mayor of a city hit so hard by Jihadists.\"\n\nThis week Mamdani met with a group of families directly affected by the conflict, according to his campaign, and he planned to attend an event on Tuesday marking the anniversary.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.9034830502101353,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Zohran Mamdani\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Democratic Party\",\n    \"role\": \"New York City Mayoral Candidate\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"Two years ago today, Hamas carried out a horrific war crime, killing more than 1,100 Israelis and kidnapping 250 more.

Agence France-Presse, which reported the video, said Hamas was targeting \"Palestinian criminal gangs and clans\" in Gaza after the signing of a ceasefire between the group and Israel.\n\nAboard Air Force One, Trump told reporters Hamas would continue to have a limited role in enforcing security operations before phase two of the peace deal started, despite the fact his 20-point deal expressly said that the group will disarm and abandon its aim to control the Gaza Strip.\n\n\"[Hamas] are standing because they do want to stop the problems, and they've been open about it, and we gave them approval for a period of time,\" Trump said.\n\nThe rebuilding of Gaza, he said, would be dangerous and difficult, suggesting the US needed to work with forces on the ground to make that possible.\n\nSpeaking in Egypt earlier, Trump said phase two of his peace deal had \"started, as far as we're concerned\", but then said some elements would be implemented over time.\n\n\"Phase two has started,\" he said. \"The phases are all a little bit mixed in with each other. You're gonna start cleaning up. You look at Gaza - it needs a lot of cleanup.\"\n\nThose remarks followed a meeting last week between senior Hamas leaders and the US's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, who provided a personal guarantee that Trump would restrain Israel from resuming the conflict if Hamas signed the peace agreement.\n\nThe meeting was held on Wednesday between Trump's envoys and a Hamas delegation headed by Khalil al-Hayya, the militant group's political leader, who survived an assassination attempt by Israel in Doha last month.\n\nThe meeting, which was first reported by the US news website Axios, was the first between the White House and Hamas since the US envoy for hostages, Adam Boehler, met Hamas leaders in Doha in March to try to secure the release of US-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander, as well as the remains of four other Americans held by the group.\n\nDuring last week's 45-minute meeting, Witkoff reportedly told Hamas that the hostages were \"more of a liability than an asset for you\" and it was time to facilitate a hostage exchange.\n\n\"President Trump's message is that you will be treated fairly and that he stands behind all 20 points of his peace plan and will make sure they are all implemented,\" Witkoff said, according to the Axios source.\n\nThe direct meeting was instrumental in securing the deal, the outlet reported, with the spy chiefs of Egypt, Turkey and Qatar speaking privately with Hamas negotiators and then telling Witkoff and Kushner: \"Based on the meeting we just had, we have a deal.\"</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.7978507426247667,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Donald Trump\",\n    \"organisation\": \"White House\",\n    \"role\": \"US president\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"If they don't disarm, we will disarm them and it will happen quickly and perhaps violently.

Sign up for The Crunch here.\n\nHello and welcome to another edition of The Crunch!\n\nIn this week's packed newsletter we have charts on pay in the WNBA, record-breaking ocean heat, how the amount of ingredients is shrinking in some foods, and a chart on who marries whom. We've also got a bird of the year update to round it out.\n\nOur colleagues in the UK have spent a year mapping the immense - and growing - Facebook networks \"whose members trade in anti-immigrant sentiment, nativism, conspiracy and misinformation\".\n\nThe journalists used artificial intelligence to draw out key themes and spoke to experts about what they found. This is one of those stories where how it was reported is almost as interesting as the story itself - you can read about the methodology here. The Guardian's principles on generative AI use are here.\n\n1. What's in our food\n\nAfter a years-long cost-of-living crisis we're all pretty familiar with \"shrinkflation\". This brilliant ABC story shows that it's not just the quantity of products like dips and jams that have been changing, but the makeup of them, too.\n\nThe ABC analysed the ingredients of thousands of products over a 15-month window and found many where the share of the \"main\" ingredient had decreased. \"While some manufacturers said their changes were to improve the recipe, others said they were due to supply chain cost increases and wanting to keep the price of the product low\". There's lots more detail and excellent charts here.\n\n2. A gender pay grand canyon\n\nThe WNBA is growing rapidly and setting attendance records. Some teams are reportedly worth 30 times what they were just six years ago, according to this New York Times story. But WNBA players aren't paid like it - the top players earn just US$250,000 a year.\n\nIf WNBA players were paid similarly to NBA players - who receive about 50% of their league's revenue - the top WNBA players would be making closer to US$3m a year (still orders of magnitude less than what male NBA stars are paid). There's a bunch of great charts in this story, we really recommend a deep dive.\n\n3. Illustrative illustrations\n\nIt was really hard to pick a graphic to highlight in this ABC story about warming oceans around Australia. It's just chock full of beautiful illustrations like this one:\n\nThe crux is that ocean temperatures in June and July were the highest they've been in over a century of data, setting up an \"extraordinary\" cyclone season, algal blooms, coral bleaching and flooding. Beyond mapping the data, there's other great illustrations in the story explaining how these environmental processes actually work.\n\nThe ABC's digital story innovation team have done a deep dive into the Australian census data around religion and marriage, in a sequel to their earlier piece looking at employment and marriage stats.\n\nAccording to their analysis, nearly one in three marriages are between people of different denominations or beliefs, and one in five are between people of different religions.\n\nThere are some great charts in there, like the chord chart above which shows the proportion of marriages and de facto relationships between people of different (and no) religions. You can also put in details about yourself and your partner to see how common or uncommon your relationship is, though this does sometimes show some strange results with less common demographics in the census.\n\nGuardian Australia's bird of the year vote - confusingly held every second year - is now on. You can vote for your favourite bird here. Five birds get knocked out every day so remember to vote often.\n\nTo help you get into the bird-appreciating spirit, Josh created an illustrated guide (and video) on how to make your own origami bird:\n\nWe have also charted the first three rounds, and not surprisingly the tawny frogmouth is well ahead of the flock:\n\nWe also wanted to shout out our data team colleague Andy Ball who built, and runs, the whole polling system that underpins the voting. Andy and all our other colleagues involved in the poll this year have done an amazing job!\n\nYou can vote here, and otherwise immerse yourself in amazing bird content here.\n\nTo mark two years on from the 7 October attacks and Israel's response, graphic designer Valentina D'Efilippo set out to create this chart, painting a dot for every life lost.

Plus, why are young Americans eating so early?\n\nDonald Trump has urged negotiators to \"move fast\" in talks focused on the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza and a broader end to the war, as representatives arrived in Egypt for discussions today.\n\nThey will focus on the first phase of Trump's plan to end the war in Gaza, the Egyptian foreign ministry has said, which is the release of the remaining 48 hostages held by Hamas in return for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.\n\nIn a social media post yesterday, the US president said talks were advancing rapidly. His encouragement came as Israel continued strikes on Gaza, killing 63 people in the 24 hours to yesterday evening.\n\nA federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying any national guard units to Oregon a few hours after the California governor, Gavin Newsom, announced he would sue the president over the planned deployment of his state's troops.\n\nBoth states sought the temporary restraining order after Trump sent guard members from California to Oregon earlier in the day. On Saturday, the same judge temporarily blocked the administration from deploying Oregon's national guard troops to Portland.\n\nThe ruling by US district judge Karin Immergut said there was no evidence that recent protests necessitated the presence of national guard troops, no matter where they came from. Immergut asked a Trump administration lawyer during a hearing on Sunday night: \"How could bringing in federalised national guard from California not be in direct contravention of the [decision] I issued yesterday?\"\n\nFrance's political crisis has deepened after the new prime minister dramatically resigned within hours of appointing a government.\n\nSébastien Lecornu was the third French prime minister in a year, as the country continued to lurch from one political crisis to another. He quit hours before his first cabinet meeting this afternoon. Macron accepted Lecornu's resignation this morning.\n\nLecornu had faced furious criticism from opposition politicians when he announced a new government that was virtually unchanged since last month's ousting of his predecessor, François Bayrou.\n\nRescue efforts are under way on Mount Everest after a snowstorm trapped nearly 1,000 people in campsites on the eastern side of the mountain, according to Chinese state media. Trekkers have described facing \"extreme\" conditions after an unseasonable snowstorm.\n\n\"Despite two years of carnage in Gaza, and everything the world has learned about Israel's true intentions, that mode is repeating itself as I write this, with global powers lining up behind a proposal that does little to ensure Palestinians gain any say over their future,\" writes Diana Buttu. \"Rhetoric without consequence has been the west's modus operandi for decades.

Many expressed the fear that the new deal would collapse, bringing more suffering to the devastated territory. Though crowds gathered in some places to dance and sing, in many places witnesses reported muted reaction amid loud overflights by warplanes and drones.\n\nIn Israel, on a day of fast-moving and sometimes chaotic developments, hospitals readied to receive hostages to be released by Hamas, the ruling coalition government met to sign off on the new ceasefire deal and thousands took to the streets of Tel Aviv to express joy and relief.\n\nPresident Trump's announcement of his \"peace proposal\" last week triggered a frantic round of indirect negotiations between Hamas and Israel in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm-el Sheikh.\n\nThe US president said on Thursday he would try to go to Egypt for the signing of the new deal.\n\n\"I'm going to try and make a trip over. We're going to try and get over there, and we're working on the timing, the exact timing,\" Trump said at a cabinet meeting. In Israel, officials suggested that the US president was expected to visit there on Sunday.\n\nTrump added that 48 hostages held by Hamas, of whom less than half are thought to be still alive, would be released on \"Monday or Tuesday\" and said that the deal had \"ended the war in Gaza\".\n\nWorld leaders scrambled to welcome the breakthrough, even if most of Trump's broader \"peace proposal\" have yet to be negotiated or even explicitly acknowledged by Hamas and Israel.\n\nThere was some confusion during Thursday on the timing of the first phase of the deal - reflecting the general uncertainty about many of its main principles.\n\nThe office of Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said the ceasefire would take effect once the agreement was ratified by his government, which convened late on Thursday after a security cabinet meeting.\n\nBut an Israeli government spokesperson said the ceasefire would go into force within 24 hours of the cabinet meeting. Those hostages believed to still be alive in Gaza would then be freed within 72 hours, they said.\n\nIsrael's forces would withdraw to an agreed line in the Gaza Strip that would leave them in control of 53% of the territory, a spokesperson for the Israeli government said.\n\nIn exchange, Israel will free about 2,000 of Palestinian prisoners, but the spokesperson said Marwan Barghouti, a senior figure in Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah movement who is hugely popular in the West Bank and Gaza and has frequently been talked of as a future leader, would not be among them. Hamas sources said the list of released prisoners was still being discussed late on Thursday.\n\nHamas called on Trump and guarantor states to ensure Israel fully implemented the ceasefire.\n\nThe exiled Gaza chief Khalil Al-Hayya said on Thursday the group has received guarantees from the United States, Arab mediators and Turkey that the war on Gaza has permanently ended, according to Reuters.\n\nUN agencies said they were ready to rush aid into Gaza, where a famine was declared by experts in August.\n\nAntónio Guterres, the UN Secretary-General, said \"to turn this ceasefire into real progress, we need more than the silencing of the guns\".\n\nGuterres called for safe access for humanitarian workers, the removal of bureaucratic obstacles to swift delivery of aid, the rebuilding of Gaza's shattered infrastructure and funding to meet the immense needs.\n\nIn Israel, thousands of people filled a square in Tel Aviv that has become a focus of the campaign to bring home the hostages. Many sang and danced as they waved Israeli and American flags.\n\n\"It feels like we can finally see a bit of light at the end of the tunnel we have all been walking through,\" said Einav Kahila, a 25-year-old student who travelled from Jerusalem. \"There's a lot of anxiety, also, because we're always feeling unsure or insecure about the situation. But the people that came here today chose to be on the side of optimism.\"\n\nEinav Zaugauker rejoiced at the prospect of freedom for her son Matan, one of the last hostages.\n\n\"I can't breathe, I can't breathe, I can't explain what I'm feeling ... it's crazy,\" she said.\n\nIn Gaza, Ola Al-Nazli, 47, said she had learned of the ceasefire from her neighbours in al-Muwasi, a crowded and squalid coastal strip where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced by successive Israeli offensives have sought shelter.\n\n\"I did not know how to feel, whether to be happy or sad. We have experienced this many times before, and each time we were disappointed again, so this time fear and caution are stronger than ever,\" al Nazli, who was forced to leave her home in Gaza City by the recent Israeli offensive there, said.\n\n\"Everyone lives in tents that do not protect from the cold or from the bombing. Those who had money or work lost everything. That is why our happiness is incomplete, mixed with pain ... I only hope that we can live in safety, not hear the sound of bombs again, not be forced to move from one place to another, and that the crossings [into Gaza from Israel] will open soon.\"\n\nSuccessful completion of the deal would mark the biggest foreign policy achievement so far for Trump, who took office in January promising to quickly end the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, only to be confronted with obstacles and complexities he had apparently not foreseen.\n\nSenior envoys from the US, Qatar and Turkey had joined the talks in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm-el-Sheikh this week, apparently adding momentum to discussions launched on Monday. Trump sent his son-in-law Jared Kushner and the special envoy Steve Witkoff. Both were reported to have arrived in Israel on Thursday night.\n\nNegotiators have closed gaps between Hamas and Israel over the details of the first phase of the 20-point plan announced by Trump, but it is unclear whether the parties had even discussed thornier questions, such as how Hamas will be disarmed, as Israel has demanded, and the eventual governance of Gaza.\n\nSenior Hamas official Osama Hamdan on Thursday told Qatar-based broadcaster Al Araby the Palestinian militant group rejects Trump's proposal for an interim \"Board of Peace\" to oversee Gaza's administration, headed by the US president himself.\n\nThough huge challenges remain, the agreement nonetheless brings the two sides closer than any previous effort to halt a war that evolved into a regional conflict, drawing in countries such as Iran, Yemen and Lebanon, and reshaping the Middle East.\n\nIn recent days, Israel reduced the intensity of its military campaign. Gaza medical authorities reported eight people were killed in Israeli strikes on Wednesday. Even if aid surges in, through the UN and the Red Crescent as specified under Trump's plan, hundreds of thousands will still not have enough food or shelter.\n\nAbout 1,200, mostly civilians, were killed in the Hamas attacks of October 2023 and 251 taken hostage. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 67,000, mostly civilians, and reduced much of Gaza to rubble.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.6408776459622864,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Donald Trump\",\n    \"organisation\": \"The White House\",\n    \"role\": \"President\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"I'm going to try and make a trip over.

Hamas has indicated that recovering the bodies of the dead may take longer than releasing those who are alive.\n\nHere are details of those who are expected to return home.\n\nIn June, Angrest's family released video that appeared to show the Israeli army soldier being pulled from a tank by scores of men at the Nahal Oz military base on 7 October 2023.\n\n\"For me as a mother, it's the hardest thing to watch,\" Anat Angrest told CNN as she explained she had decided to make the video public due to fears her son had been abandoned and forgotten by officials.\n\nThe twin brothers were taken hostage at Kfar Aza kibbutz, less than two miles from the border with Gaza.\n\nSpeaking to the Guardian one month after their abduction, their older brother Liran Berman said life would never be the same. \"We had our lives before October 7 and now we don't know what will happen in the future,\" he said. \"Even if my brothers are released, it will leave lifelong scars.\"\n\nBohbot was taken captive at the Nova music festival during the raids on 7 October 2023. He had stayed behind to try to help those wounded during the attacks, according to the American Jewish Committee.\n\nIn May he was identified as the hostage seen in a video published by Hamas's armed wing. The video appeared to show Bohbot in duress. He said the bombardment could cost him his life and he pleaded to be reunited with his wife and son.\n\nBraslavski was also abducted at the Nova music festival, where he was working as a security guard, according to the World Jewish Congress. His family was later told he had saved a number of people before being kidnapped.\n\nIn April, he appeared in a video filmed by his captors in Gaza. The footage, which appeared to show him emaciated and in tears, sparked international condemnation.\n\nCohen, a corporal in the Israeli army, was guarding the area near the Nirim kibbutz close to Gaza's frontier when his unit was overrun by armed militants, his father, Yehuda Cohen, recently told UN News.\n\nThis week, as news emerged of the ceasefire deals, his father said it was the moment the family had been waiting for. \"It could have come much earlier. Let this next three days pass with no one trying to sabotage it,\" he told reporters.\n\nThe two brothers were kidnapped from Nir Oz kibbutz. Ariel was taken alongside his girlfriend, Arbel Yehoud, who was released in January, while David was abducted with his wife, Sharon Aloni Cunio, who was released in November 2023 along with their three-year-old twin daughters, Ema and Yuly.\n\nAriel and David's father, Luis Cunio, this week wrote a piece in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz detailing how the family had been \"living the unknown\" for two years. His granddaughters \"don't understand why their father and uncle aren't returning; they live the trauma every day\", he said. \"At night they wake up crying; all kinds of things. It's very hard for us.\"\n\nTheir father expressed cautious optimism that the family's ordeal would soon be over. \"I hope we'll see you soon, so hang on. We have no choice but to believe that at the end of the day, this story will end.\"\n\nDavid was taken at the Nova music festival. In August his family expressed fears that Hamas was starving him after he was seen on video saying he had not eaten for days and had received barely any drinking water.\n\nThe footage prompted outrage and dismay across Israel. In comments made under duress, David appeared to urge the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to agree to a ceasefire.\n\nIn a statement, the family accused Hamas of starving David for propaganda.\n\nGilboa-Dalal was at the Nova festival, dancing with his brother in a grove of trees just a few miles from Gaza. Soon after, he was kidnapped by Hamas.\n\n\"It's so hard missing him all day every day, thinking about him all day every day,\" his brother, Gal Gilboa-Dalal, told the Guardian this week. \"And as time goes by it's getting harder and harder [to bear], and harder and harder to see the light at the end of the tunnel.\"\n\nHerkin was also at the Nova music festival when he was kidnapped. The Russian-Israeli dual citizen had attended the event by chance after being invited by friends at the last minute, according to the Times of Israel.\n\nBorn in the Donbas region of Ukraine, he has a three-year-old daughter and was the primary provider for his mother and 11-year-old brother.\n\nHorn was kidnapped along with his brother, Iair, from Iair's home in Nir Oz kibbutz.\n\nIair was released in February and told the Times of Israel in July that he had set aside his own recovery to focus on the release of his brother and the other hostages still in Gaza. \"My life is frozen right now,\" he said. \"I live in a nightmare that every day they are kidnapping me anew.\"\n\nThis week, their father spoke to the Guardian about the imminent return of his son. \"I felt good when I heard the news but I will feel much better when I see Eitan and the rest of the hostages. With God's help, he will return on Monday from hell,\" said Itzik Horn, 73.\n\nKalfon was abducted as he was trying to leave the Nova festival. Earlier he had been on the phone with his family as the vehicle he was in slowly inched forward, trapped in a traffic jam of people trying to flee the area.\n\n\"We were on the phone for an hour with him until 8.10am,\" his father, Kobi Kalfon, told the Times of Israel in July. \"It was crazy, atomic pressure. I told them just to run.\"\n\nA friend told the family that Hamas militants had approached the car and grabbed Segev, who at the time was studying finance at a Tel Aviv university. His family has spoken out about their worries about his health, particularly as he had been diagnosed with a severe form of anxiety and put on medication weeks before the 7 October attacks.\n\nKupershtein was kidnapped at the Nova music festival, where he had been working as a bouncer. During the attack he stayed behind to assist the Israeli police and security team and provide first aid to the injured, according to the Jerusalem Post.\n\nIn May his family was among the thousands of Israelis who took to the streets to call for a ceasefire that would bring the remaining hostages home from Gaza. \"The only thing that keeps us going is the hope that Bar is alive and surviving,\" his aunt Ora Rubinstein told Reuters at the time.\n\nMiran was at his home in kibbutz Nahal Oz with his wife, Lishay Lavi, and their daughters, Roni and Alma, when they were woken by sirens. As they took shelter in their safe room, word came that Hamas had begun to enter some of the homes.\n\nThe militants forced one of their teenage neighbours to bang on the door of their safe room and it was made clear to them that the teenager and the family would be shot if they did not open up. The family did so and eventually Miran was tied up and led away, his wife told the Guardian.\n\n\"Roni was terrified, screaming. She tried to go with her daddy, I had to hold her back. I told Omri I love him and not to be a hero. I said do whatever they want because I want you back,\" said Lavi.\n\nIn August, Miran's brother-in-law spoke to the US broadcaster NPR about the family's ordeal. \"Roni just celebrated her fourth birthday - a second without her father,\" Moshe Lavi said. \"Alma is two years old, [she's] never celebrated a birthday with her father. He was kidnapped when she was six months old.\"\n\nMor was working as a security guard at the Nova music festival. A survivor later said he had spotted Mor and a friend bringing others to safety before he was kidnapped, according to the Times of Israel.\n\nIn February the family of Ohana said, without providing further details, that they had received a \"clear\" sign that he was alive, after being taken hostage at the Nova music festival.\n\nAt the time of his capture, he and a friend had been attempting to provide aid to injured partygoers, according to the Times of Israel, while the Jerusalem Post said he had gone to the festival with friends to celebrate his imminent departure to the US to take a pilot course.\n\n\"[He is a] strong guy, both in mind and body,\" his aunt Hana Mastronov told reporters recently. \"But there are limits to how much strength a person has.\"\n\nOhel was kidnapped at the Nova festival. In August, his mother wrote a piece for the Observer pleading for leaders around the world to do more to end the war and bring the hostages home.\n\n\"My son and the other hostages, most of them young men, still have their whole lives ahead of them. I know that my son will play the piano again, filling the air with everything from Beethoven to Elton John to his own songs,\" wrote Idit Ohel.\n\n\"I know my son will begin his studies at the music school where he was accepted, that he will surf again, cook again and do all the other things that brought a smile to his face. I want to believe that I will hug him again,\" she added. \"Please, help make that possible.\"\n\nOr was kidnapped at gunpoint along with his girlfriend, Noa Argamani, at the Nova music festival. Argamani was released after 245 days in captivity.\n\nSpeaking this week, Argamani said: \"Avinatan is someone words can't describe.\" She told the news website Ynet Global: \"There's this quiet strength in him that radiates peace. One of the sayings he loved was: 'A lion doesn't have to roar to let the other animals know he's king.' That's exactly who he is - always present, even when silent.\"\n\nZanguaker was abducted with his partner, Ilana Gritzewsky, from their home in Nir Oz kibbutz. Gritzewsky was released in November 2023.\n\nIn a letter published this week, his mother, Einav Zangauker, said she was hoping to be able to hug her son soon. \"For two years I've imagined how I will hold you close to my breast, the way a mother hugs her newborn child,\" she wrote in Haaretz. \"I wonder what will be the first words I say. I long to hear you call me Mom. I can't imagine that moment when I'll have you back again.\"</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.2224986785445448,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Anat Angrest\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"For me as a mother, it's the hardest thing to watch,\",\n    \"message\": \"Watching the video of her son being pulled from a tank by scores of men at the Nahal Oz military base was the hardest thing for her to witness as a mother.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Liran Berman\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"We had our lives before October 7 and now we don't know what will happen in the future.\",\n    \"message\": \"Their lives were normal before October 7th, but now the future is uncertain due to his brothers' abduction.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Liran Berman\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"Even if my brothers are released, it will leave lifelong scars.\",\n    \"message\": \"Even if his brothers are released from captivity, the experience of their abduction will leave lifelong scars on them and the family.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Yehuda Cohen\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"It could have come much earlier.

But they say Britain has done more than simply show that it cares about the outcome of the conflict.\n\nThe prime minister's spokesperson said on Monday: \"We've been offering our full support for these efforts, over the last few weeks and months, including working behind the scenes with the US, Arab and European nations to help develop ideas and build consensus on the steps that need to be taken to deliver a plan for Gaza's future.\"\n\nOfficials point to the roles played by Powell and Tony Blair, the former prime minister, and insist that their experience in piloting the Northern Ireland peace process proved invaluable in bringing Israel and Hamas to the negotiating table.\n\nThey claim this influence was in part substantive. Point 13 of the 20-point peace plan, for example, deals with demilitarisation of Gaza, mirroring how important weapons decommissioning proved in the Good Friday agreement.\n\nPoint 18 meanwhile calls for an \"interfaith dialogue process\" aimed at \"emphasizing the benefits that can be derived from peace\" - an echo of the Forum for Reconciliation and Peace, which was set up in Northern Ireland in 1994.\n\nSome experts reject the idea that Powell, Blair or anyone in Starmer's government could have helped shape the substance of the peace deal, not least because it is based on a similar one promoted by the former president Joe Biden before Labour entered government.\n\n\"This deal has been on the table since Biden,\" said Maddox. \"It has very little to do with the Good Friday agreement.\"\n\nOne area where Powell does appear to have had an influence however is persuading all sides to enter the peace process without necessarily knowing the outcome.\n\n\"What Northern Ireland taught us is that taking part in the process builds its own trust and momentum,\" said one official. \"So even if you don't believe the other side will stick to their commitments, you embark on phase one anyway as a way to show commitment and generate the trust, which comes later.\"\n\nStarmer himself spent much of Monday talking to other world leaders in Sharm-El Sheikh, repeatedly emphasising that the UK \"stands ready to play a leadership role in the reconstruction of Gaza\", according to statements from Downing Street.\n\nThe prime minister told leaders including the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and Jordan's King Abdullah that Britain could specifically help monitor the process of Hamas decommissioning its weapons.\n\nMeanwhile Hamish Falconer, the Middle East minister, is leading a three-day summit at Wilton Park dedicated to discussing the reconstruction of Gaza - with the UK offering £20m in aid towards the effort.\n\nBut whether the British government will play a more direct role in any transition authority appears to remain undecided.\n\n\"The precise membership and shape of that board is all still subject to discussion,\" No 10 said on Monday.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.1782510351299276,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Mike Huckabee\",\n    \"organisation\": \"US Government\",\n    \"role\": \"US ambassador to Israel\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"delusional\",\n    \"message\": \"Bridget Phillipson's statement about the United Kingdom's significant role in the Gaza peace agreement is delusional.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Richard Kemp\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"former British military officer\",\n    \"nationality\": \"GBR\",\n    \"quote\": \"The British government played no role in the ceasefire agreement, except a negative one by encouraging Hamas to resist through recognition of a nonexistent 'Palestinian state'.\",\n    \"message\": \"The British government played no role in the ceasefire agreement, except a negative one by encouraging Hamas to resist through recognition of a nonexistent Palestinian state.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Bronwen Maddox\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Chatham House\",\n    \"role\": \"director\",\n    \"nationality\": \"GBR\",\n    \"quote\": \"The UK has made it very clear all along that it cares about this, and that matters,\",\n    \"message\": \"The United Kingdom has consistently expressed its concern about this situation, and that concern is significant.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Bronwen Maddox\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Chatham House\",\n    \"role\": \"director\",\n    \"nationality\": \"GBR\",\n    \"quote\": \"For all that Israel complained about the UK recognising Palestinian statehood, that did play an important role in signalling how engaged the UK and others were in what was happening in the region.\",\n    \"message\": \"Despite Israel's complaints about the United Kingdom recognizing Palestinian statehood, this action significantly indicated the level of engagement the UK and other parties had in the region's events.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Bronwen Maddox\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Chatham House\",\n    \"role\": \"director\",\n    \"nationality\": \"GBR\",\n    \"quote\": \"This deal has been on the table since Biden,\",\n    \"message\": \"The current peace agreement has been a standing proposal since the administration of President Joe Biden.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Bronwen Maddox\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Chatham House\",\n    \"role\": \"director\",\n    \"nationality\": \"GBR\",\n    \"quote\": \"It has very little to do with the Good Friday agreement.\",\n    \"message\": \"The current peace deal bears minimal resemblance to the Good Friday Agreement.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Downing Street\",\n    \"organisation\": \"UK Government\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"GBR\",\n    \"quote\": \"stands ready to play a leadership role in the reconstruction of Gaza\",\n    \"message\": \"The UK government is prepared to take a leading role in the reconstruction efforts for Gaza.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"No 10\",\n    \"organisation\": \"UK Government\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"GBR\",\n    \"quote\": \"The precise membership and shape of that board is all still subject to discussion,\",\n    \"message\": \"The exact composition and structure of the transition authority's board are currently still under deliberation.\"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP"}],"createTime":"2025-10-15T10:37:04.138854Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"UHnvaOa8CKuYmecPr_2-8QY","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":742,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":742}],"promptTokenCount":1364,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1364}],"thoughtsTokenCount":3987,"totalTokenCount":6093,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}}}

Some of the blue and white signs were in Hebrew, others Arabic. This one was in English. Later, as soon as she had access to a pen, the Australian documentary maker would scribble it down, as best as she could recall, upon a serviette.\n\n\"The eternal state never forgets and will pursue its enemies till the end\".\n\nThose were the words fluttering upon a banner in the Negev desert that Lamont read as she entered Ketziot prison in Israel.\n\n\"It was terrifying,\" she says.\n\nLamont, 54, who has two children, was a world away from her home in the Northern Rivers of New South Wales.\n\nInside the walls of a prison primarily used to detain Palestinian prisoners, many of whom Israel accuses of involvement in militant or terrorist activities, other words ringing in her head were those of Itamar Ben-Gvir.\n\nIsrael's far-right national security minister had just berated her and hundreds of other activists from around the world who had been attempting to break the Israeli siege of Gaza by delivering aid. Those on the Global Sumud Flotilla saw themselves as humanitarians. Ben-Gvir had called them \"terrorists\". He called them, she says, \"the enemy of Israel\".\n\nLamont says she was taken to a cell she shared with 15 other women. It was about 6m long and 3.5m wide.\n\n\"It really started to feel like there wasn't enough oxygen in there to even breathe,\" she says.\n\nBut some fears were more immediate than that of slow suffocation.\n\n\"They would wake us up in the middle of the night by bringing two really big dogs into the cell, [the guards] in full riot gear and train their semi automatic machine guns into our heads with these laser beams,\" Lamont says.\n\nThis was not the first time that Lamont says an Israeli firearm was directed at her forehead. That began from the moment her ship was intercepted in the Mediterranean by Israeli security forces last Thursday morning.\n\nLamont says the crew of the Wahoo were cable-tied and forced below deck where the lasers of semi-automatic machine guns were trained on them for nine hours.\n\n\"We weren't allowed to go to the toilet,\" she says. \"So all the denials, food and all of that, began then\".\n\nThe \"humiliations\" continued, Lamont recalls, in the port of Ashdod where they were also cable-tied and forced to kneel in the blazing sun for hours. They were smacked with rifles if they moved. Lamont says she was stripped and cavity-searched by a woman. Her \"breasts and arse\" groped by men who, she says, taunted her.\n\nFurther denials, she says, included access to lawyers, doctors and the medication she needed for her blood pressure, which had been confiscated upon her capture.\n\n\"I just kept going: 'I do not want to have a stroke in this awful place'.\"\n\nThat sign before the Ketziot prison about pursuing enemies until the end also looms large in the recollections of another of the seven Australian activists who was detained there until all were released and deported to Jordan early Tuesday morning, local time.\n\nBianca Webb-Pullman's account of her ordeal begins prior to the flotilla's interception, when her boat came under a drone strike. She also saw the \"humiliation\" of Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, witnessed by many, and humiliations more private - women not provided sanitary products and left to bleed through their clothes.\n\nBut it was another sign that chills the 52-year-old general practitioner from St Kilda, Melbourne, more deeply still.\n\n\"It was a big poster of decimated Gaza with people walking down the street in the destroyed buildings,\" she says.\n\nThe Arabic writing was translated to Webb-Pullman by a cellmate as: \"the new Gaza\".\n\n\"That wasn't targeted at us,\" she says. \"That was targeted at the Palestinian prisoners.\"\n\nWhat struck Webb-Pullman in that moment, she says, was \"a tiny taste of what Palestinians have routinely received over decades\".\n\n\"Our treatment would be nothing ... minor compared to what we know is being inflicted on Palestinian prisoners,\" she says. \"They didn't tell us what was happening - well they sure as hell don't tell people who are in administrative detention for years on end without even knowing why they are there\".\n\nWhich, perhaps, explains why she doesn't hesitate for a moment when asked: would she do it again? Would she sail in another aid flotilla for Gaza?\n\n\"Yes,\" she says. \"Absolutely. And I hate boats.\n\n\"This is one of the greatest moral failures that Australia has ever had, I believe, and if our government won't stand up - it's up to us as citizens to do that\".\n\nLamont is staying in the same hotel in Amman, Jordan, and shares the conviction of her compatriot.\n\n\"We want to come back [to Australia] and fundraise and get more boats and we want to break the siege,\" she says. \"We've had a rest, we've had some croissants and some nice hotel coffee. We just have to hit the ground running\".\n\nThe Guardian contacted Israel's prison service, the Israel Defense Forces, the country's ministry for foreign affairs and the Israeli embassy in Australia but none have responded to a request for comment.\n\nThe ABC, Australia's national broadcaster reported that Israel's foreign ministry rejected allegations that prisoners were mistreated.\n\n\"The claims of the mistreatment of Australians who were on board are complete lies,\" the statement reportedly said.\n\n\"All their legal rights, including access to medical care, were fully upheld\".</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.7256068771342916,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Juliet Lamont\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"Australian documentary maker\",\n    \"nationality\": \"AUS\",\n    \"quote\": \"The eternal state never forgets and will pursue its enemies till the end.\",\n    \"message\": \"A banner seen at Ketziot prison displayed text stating that the eternal state will never forget its enemies and will pursue them until the end.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Juliet Lamont\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"Australian documentary maker\",\n    \"nationality\": \"AUS\",\n    \"quote\": \"It was terrifying.\",\n    \"message\": \"The experience of entering Ketziot prison was terrifying.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Itamar Ben-Gvir\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Israeli Government\",\n    \"role\": \"National Security Minister\",\n    \"nationality\": \"ISR\",\n    \"quote\": \"the enemy of Israel\",\n    \"message\": \"Activists attempting to break the Israeli siege of Gaza were referred to as Israel's enemies.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Juliet Lamont\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"Australian documentary maker\",\n    \"nationality\": \"AUS\",\n    \"quote\": \"It really started to feel like there wasn't enough oxygen in there to even breathe.\",\n    \"message\": \"The cell shared with 15 other women felt as though it did not contain enough oxygen to breathe.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Juliet Lamont\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"Australian documentary maker\",\n    \"nationality\": \"AUS\",\n    \"quote\": \"They would wake us up in the middle of the night by bringing two really big dogs into the cell, [the guards] in full riot gear and train their semi automatic machine guns into our heads with these laser beams.\",\n    \"message\": \"Guards woke up prisoners in the middle of the night by bringing large dogs into the cell, wearing full riot gear, and pointing semi-automatic machine guns with laser beams at their heads.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Juliet Lamont\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"Australian documentary maker\",\n    \"nationality\": \"AUS\",\n    \"quote\": \"We weren't allowed to go to the toilet.

He said: \"This means that ALL of the Hostages will be released very soon, and Israel will withdraw their Troops to an agreed upon line as the first steps toward a Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace.\"\n\nHamas said it had reached the agreement, confirming the deal includes an Israeli withdrawal from the enclave and a hostage-prisoner exchange. The group said in a statement the deal came after \"responsible and serious negotiations\" over the Trump's proposal.\n\nIsraeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked the US \"for their commitment to this sacred mission of freeing our hostages\" and said \"with God's help, we will bring them all home.\" Netanyahu said he would convene the Israeli government on Thursday to approve the deal.\n\nIn recent days negotiators have been meeting in Egypt to close gaps between Hamas and Israel over the details of the \"first phase\" of a 21-point plan announced by Trump in the White House last week.\n\nHamas plans to release all 20 living hostages this weekend, people familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. The deceased hostages will come out in a later stage in phases. The Israel army will move out of 70% of the area, they said. In exchange, several hundred Palestinian prisoners held by Israel would be released.\n\nThe Hostages Families Forum, a grassroots organisation representing many of the hostage families, said it received the news of a ceasefire with \"excitement, anticipation, and apprehension.\" The Forum called on the Israeli government to immediately convene to approve the deal, and praised Trump for his \"commitment and determination that led to this historic breakthrough.\"\n\nA Qatar foreign ministry spokesperson confirmed Israel and Hamas reached an agreement for the first phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal. The agreement \"will lead to ending the war, the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, and the entry of aid,\" said Majed al-Ansari, Qatar's foreign ministry spokesperson, speaking on behalf of the mediators of the deal. He said the details will be announced later.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the parties had made any progress on thornier questions about the future of the conflict, including whether Hamas will demilitarise, as Trump has demanded, and eventual governance of the war-torn territory.\n\nUN chief António Guterres welcomed the Israel-Hamas agreement announced Wednesday by US President Donald Trump on the first phase of his peace plan for Gaza, calling on all parties to \"abide fully\" by its terms.\n\nTrump said earlier that a deal was almost done and that he may travel to Egypt this weekend, possibly leaving as soon as Saturday.\n\nThe war began with Hamas' 7 October 2023, attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 people, many of them civilians. Israel's retaliatory military campaign has left more than 67,000 Palestinians dead, devastated Gaza and upended global politics.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.7041199163342199,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Donald Trump\",\n    \"organisation\": \"US Government\",\n    \"role\": \"US President\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"This means that ALL of the Hostages will be released very soon, and Israel will withdraw their Troops to an agreed upon line as the first steps toward a Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace.\",\n    \"message\": \"All hostages will be released very soon, and Israel will withdraw its troops to an agreed-upon line, which are the first steps toward a strong, durable, and everlasting peace in the region.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Hamas\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Hamas\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"PLE\",\n    \"quote\": \"responsible and serious negotiations\",\n    \"message\": \"The deal between Hamas and Israel, which includes an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a hostage-prisoner exchange, came after responsible and serious negotiations.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Benjamin Netanyahu\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Government of Israel\",\n    \"role\": \"Israeli prime minister\",\n    \"nationality\": \"ISR\",\n    \"quote\": \"for their commitment to this sacred mission of freeing our hostages\",\n    \"message\": \"Benjamin Netanyahu thanked the United States for its commitment to the sacred mission of freeing Israeli hostages held in Gaza.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Benjamin Netanyahu\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Government of Israel\",\n    \"role\": \"Israeli prime minister\",\n    \"nationality\": \"ISR\",\n    \"quote\": \"with God's help, we will bring them all home.\",\n    \"message\": \"Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his belief that with God's help, all Israeli hostages will be brought home from Gaza.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"The Hostages Families Forum\",\n    \"organisation\": \"The Hostages Families Forum\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"ISR\",\n    \"quote\": \"excitement, anticipation, and apprehension.\",\n    \"message\": \"The Hostages Families Forum received the news of a ceasefire and hostage release deal with excitement, anticipation, and apprehension.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"The Hostages Families Forum\",\n    \"organisation\": \"The Hostages Families Forum\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"ISR\",\n    \"quote\": \"commitment and determination that led to this historic breakthrough.\",\n    \"message\": \"The Hostages Families Forum praised Donald Trump for his commitment and determination that led to the historic breakthrough in the ceasefire and hostage release negotiations.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Majed al-Ansari\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Qatar's foreign ministry\",\n    \"role\": \"spokesperson\",\n    \"nationality\": \"QAT\",\n    \"quote\": \"will lead to ending the war, the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, and the entry of aid,\",\n    \"message\": \"The agreement between Israel and Hamas for the first phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal will lead to ending the war, the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, and the entry of aid into Gaza.\"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP"}],"createTime":"2025-10-15T10:37:03.995263Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"T3nvaL_fPL7_ld8Pi-Kc6QE","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":705,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":705}],"promptTokenCount":1059,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1059}],"thoughtsTokenCount":2187,"totalTokenCount":3951,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}}}

Maria Corina Machado has led the fight for freedom and democracy in Venezuela with courage and dignity. Perhaps she will eventually help bring about real change in a country that has suffered from a succession of terrible rulers.\n\nAnd yet surely almost anyone apart from the Nobel Peace Prize committee in Oslo can see who the real winner of this year's award should be: President Trump. Sure, we will have to see if it holds, but the ceasefire in Gaza is the diplomatic coup of the century.\n\nThe sceptics said it could never be done. The two sides were too far apart. Too much blood had already been spilled. And that the fanatics on both sides would never settle for anything less than total victory and the complete annihilation of the other side.\n\nAnd yet despite all that President Trump will, so long as everything goes to plan, be in Egypt this weekend to attend a signing ceremony. The hostages will be released. And the fighting will stop - at least for now.\n\nIn reality, President Trump got three big things right. First, he stuck to his principles. He was not willing to sell out the state of Israel or compromise the long term security of America's closest ally in the region. Unlike Europe's pitiful leaders, and not least Britain's Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, he was not willing to recognise a Palestinian state, nor to offer the terror group any rewards for the brutal assault it launched on Israel back in 2023.\n\nSecond, he was robust. We always knew he would be tough with Hamas. But he was also willing to play hard with the other states across the Middle East that shape the conflict in the background, while his strikes on Iran earlier this year weakened the position of the one country most likely to scupper a deal. At the same time, he put pressure on the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanahyu to compromise, making it clear that US support was not unconditional.\n\nFinally, he has a plan for the post-war reconstruction of the strip. Sure, people will laugh at his \"Gaza Riviera\" project. A new generation of \"Gaz-illionaires\" seems unlikely right now. But 30 years ago the idea of turning the Dubai desert into a great trading centre seemed almost as ridiculous. It is only prosperity that will bring a lasting peace to the region, and Trump, who has always been in his element planning new condos and luxury resorts, has set out a vision of what a post-war Gaza might look like.\n\nAdd it all up, and one point is surely clear. President Trump has pulled off the diplomatic coup of the century so far. The Nobel prize committee clearly suffers from such a severe case of \"Trump Derangement Syndrome\" that they can't see that. But (almost) everyone else can - and who knows, perhaps even the committee will put that right when next October rolls around.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-24.49028778076172,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP"}],"createTime":"2025-10-15T10:37:04.076161Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"UHnvaIHTBNKLmecP4pHTwQs","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":6,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":6}],"promptTokenCount":1025,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1025}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1319,"totalTokenCount":2350,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}}}

Under the terms of the plan Hamas is expected to release the 20 living Israeli hostages within 72 hours, after which Israel will release 250 Palestinians serving long terms in Israeli prisons, as well as 1,700 others detained in Gaza during the war.\n\nThe Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, claimed credit for the hostage release, saying in an address on Friday that the \"security of Israel\" was what dictated his actions in Gaza.\n\n\"I believed that if we applied heavy military pressure, combined with heavy diplomatic pressure, we would absolutely be able to return all of our hostages,\" said Netanyahu, who also thanked the US president, Donald Trump, for his support to achieve the deal.\n\nAvichay Adraee, an Israeli Arabic-language military spokesperson, said residents of Gaza could return north via specific routes, while warning them away from areas such as Beit Hanoun and the Rafah border crossing, where troops remained. Israeli bombing intensified in Gaza on Friday morning up until the ceasefire began.\n\nAccording to an Israeli government spokesperson speaking on Thursday, Israeli forces will remain in control of 53% of Gaza in the initial withdrawal phase before the hostages are released. Israeli troops were seen pulling back from areas such as the eastern part of Khan Younis, southern Gaza, and the Nuseirat camp in central Gaza, but troops were still visible in other parts of the strip.\n\nWith the announcement that a ceasefire had begun, a massive column of Palestinians began filing north towards Gaza City, the territory's biggest urban area. Nearly half a million Palestinians living in north Gaza had been displaced by Israel's military operation in Gaza City, and many of them were eager to return to their homes.\n\nFootage showed huge crowds on the coastal road, which had been cut off for returnees just days prior.\n\n\"Thank God my house is still standing,\" said 40-year-old Ismail Zayda in the Sheikh Radwan area of Gaza City. \"But the place is destroyed, my neighbours' houses are destroyed, entire districts have gone,\" he told Reuters.\n\nThe ceasefire is meant to be accompanied by a surge in humanitarian and medical aid into Gaza through all five crossings into the besieged strip. Israel will allow 600 aid trucks in to Gaza every day, according to Israeli Army Radio, which is roughly equivalent to prewar levels.\n\nThe aid is sorely needed, as malnutrition is rife in the strip, parts of which are in the throes of famine, according to the world's leading authority on food crises.\n\nMedical workers announced that they would use the ceasefire period to start recovering bodies trapped under rubble. Tens of thousands of bodies are expected to be under the debris of ruined buildings, as fighting made excavation and recovery difficult.\n\nKhalil al-Hayya, a senior Hamas official and lead negotiator for the group, said he had received international guarantees that the war was over.\n\nHowever, much of Trump's 20-point plan to end the two-year war still needs to be ironed out by negotiators. Trump's plan also calls for Hamas to disarm, for the Gaza Strip to be governed by an international transitional government, and for a full Israeli withdrawal to a buffer zone on the strip's border.\n\nThe topic of Hamas's arms, as well as the makeup of the transitional authority, is expected to be more of a challenge to negotiators than the exchange of hostages and detainees. Hamas and Israel have sharply differing visions on both topics.\n\nNonetheless, the Israeli TV channel 12 reported that Trump would visit Israel on Monday to deliver a speech at the Knesset in Jerusalem.\n\nFriday's ceasefire is the first cessation in fighting in more than six months and the closest that Israel and Hamas have gotten to permanently ending the war in Gaza.\n\nIsrael's two-year military campaign in Gaza killed more than 67,000 Palestinians and wounded nearly 170,000 more, according to the Gaza ministry of health. Tens of thousands more bodies are expected to be buried under the rubble. Israel launched the war in response to a Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023 that killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostage.\n\nA UN commission of inquiry and several human rights bodies have accused Israel of conducting a genocide in Gaza over the past two years.

More than 67,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, have been killed in Israel's assault on Gaza. The war began after a Hamas-led incursion into Israel in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.\n\nThe negotiations, mediated by Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey, and involving US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, precipitated the truce and subsequent increase of humanitarian aid into Gaza.\n\nThe announcement came as thousands of Palestinians journeyed along the north of Gaza on Saturday, trekking by foot, car, and cart back to what was left of their homes.\n\n\"It is an indescribable feeling; praise be to God,\" Nabila Basa told Reuters, as she travelled by foot with her daughter, who she said had suffered a head wound in the war. \"We are very, very happy that the war has stopped, and the suffering has ended.\"\n\nFor many in Gaza, there is no home to return to, as the war has reduced their neighbourhoods to dust after two years of heavy bombardment.\n\n\"My house, which I built 40 years ago, was gone in a moment,\" said Ahmed al-Jabari, as he stood in the wreckage of a Gaza City street. \"I'm happy that there is no blood, no killing (but) where will we go?

Not from normal people, obviously, but from a chunk of our intellectual elites. Why is it that flying the national flag has become an act of defiance against our own rulers?\n\nLeft-wingers in France or Greece or Argentina are generally patriotic, and rightly so. It is natural to feel an attachment to the nation that gave you your birth and infant nurture. Here, though, distaste for this country hovers behind all manner of apparently unconnected political movements.\n\nLook at the anti-Israel marchers mooching around trying to find a new sense of purpose. If their sole motivation had been peace in Gaza, they would now be delighted. And, to be fair, some of them are. But those clinging most aggressively to their keffiyehs were never motivated by humanitarian concerns; for them, it was really about defeating a country that they believed was created by Britain, a country they saw as white, wealthy and Western.\n\nContemplate those elderly buffoons in blue berets who hand out EU flags at the Last Night of the Proms. Do you suppose they have any real interest in rejoining the EU? Do they strike you as having looked into the budgetary, migratory and commercial implications? Of course not. They just loathe the people they imagine having voted Leave.\n\nListen to Sir Lenny Henry, who thinks that, as well as handing over squillions to the West Indies and Africa, we should pay black people in this country. So much for the notion of equality before the law.\n\nI could go on. The museums rushing to give away legally purchased collections to people who have never owned them, and who will very probably sell them on to private collectors. The diplomats longing to surrender British territories in defiance of the wishes of their peoples. The universities eviscerating the Western canon in the name of decolonising the curriculum.\n\nWhat is it that fills them with such distaste for the country which, other things being equal, they should love the most?\n\nIs it that Britain is uniquely despicable? Far from it. By any normal measure, we have been one of the strongest defenders of freedom and fairness in history. When we talk of a country improving, we generally mean that it is becoming more like Britain: that power can change hands peacefully, that dissidents are not imprisoned, that individuals have rights, that disagreeable opinions are tolerated, that the armed forces are under civilian control.\n\nNo nation is perfect, obviously, but few have better records. We developed and exported the idea of parliamentary democracy. We did not just abolish slavery on our own territory; we pressured others to follow our lead. We bankrupted ourselves saving our neighbours from tyranny, whether Bonapartist, Nazi or Soviet.\n\nEven if we look only at the criteria that Leftists care about, it is hard to see how Britain ends up as one of the baddies. Where, down the centuries, would you rather have been poor, or female, or from a religious minority? Seriously, where? Muscovy? Persia? Dahomey?\n\nIn order to maintain such self-loathing, it is necessary not simply to ignore context and perspective but to invert things. Every country practised slavery, but reparations are sought solely from the one that poured its blood and treasure into eliminating the foul trade.\n\nTo condemn colonialism, everything that came before and followed after must be expunged from the record, and colonised peoples presented as having lived in prelapsarian bliss.\n\n\"Colonialism-and-slavery\" is proffered as a binomial phrase, like \"law-and-order\" or \"gin-and-tonic\". Few kids in our schools are given the slightest notion that the first, at least in Africa, was driven by the desire to extirpate the second. Even fewer are taught that African kings fought to defend the institution.\n\nThe Benin Bronzes, which our cultural leaders are so keen to give away, were seized to defray the costs of an 1897 expedition against a state that buried slaves alive. The British Museum, which owns most of them, dares not mention it. Instead it says the carvings were acquired during the \"expansion of colonial power\".\n\nWhere does it come from, our peculiar masochism? No other country goes in for it to the same degree, not even Germany. There are, I think, two sources. First, as Jonathan Haidt showed in The Righteous Mind, Left-wing politics is largely predicated on the desire to stand up for the perceived underdog, almost regardless of the rights and wrongs of the situation.\n\nBritain, because it industrialised earlier than other nations, has rarely been the underdog. That is why the anti-British crowd tend to wax patriotic only when there is some quarrel with the United States - it is one of the few occasions when they can enjoy being the weaker party.\n\nSecond, although they almost certainly do not realise it, many woke activists are channelling Lenin, who promulgated the doctrine of anti-colonialism as we know it.\n\nKarl Marx himself, to the embarrassment of the more literate of his modern devotees, was a fan of imperialism, seeing it as the way to spread education, medicine and class consciousness. The old cadger loathed Britain, the country that had given him sanctuary. But he nonetheless saw its colonisation of India as a historical necessity. \"England\", he wrote, must \"accomplish the annihilation of old Asiatic society, and the laying of the material foundations of Western society in Asia\".\n\nLenin was a fanatical disciple of Marx, seeing his treatises, not as political opinions, but as scientific facts. But, by the early twentieth century, he was becoming worried. Why had the forecast revolutions not taken place? It was unthinkable that Marx himself had been wrong, so something else must have happened.\n\nIn 1916, he hit on the answer. The capitalists, he argued, had bought themselves time by draining resources from their colonies, thereby staving off the proletarian immiseration that would eventually bring them down. In short, he averred, \"capitalism has been transformed into imperialism\".\n\nAfter the Russian Revolution, this idea was sedulously spread by Soviet propagandists, hoping to weaken the West. Lenin's 1917 book, Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism, was widely disseminated among young socialists in the Global South - and, naturally, in Western universities.\n\nIts thesis became the world-view that we now call \"woke\". Western countries in general, and Britain in particular, did not become wealthy through capitalism, private property or free contract. No. The only way, according to Marxist doctrine, that they could possibly have enriched themselves was through plunder.\n\nThis idea began to pour from the pens of anti-colonial writers in Asia, Africa and Latin America, all of them consciously developing the Leninist doctrines they had read as young men.\n\n\"White hordes have sallied forth from their western European homelands to assault, loot, occupy, rule and exploit the world,\" wrote the Nigerian author Chinweizu.\n\n\"The well-being and progress of Europe have been built up with the sweat and the dead bodies of Blacks, Arabs, Indians and the yellow races,\" declared the Martinican socialist Frantz Fanon.\n\nSuch views motivate many of the groups I began with, though some would be surprised at their provenance. One of the paradoxes of our age is that, 35 years after all those little Lenin statues were torn down, one of his silliest ideas continues to infect our public institutions.\n\nFor it is impossible to delegitimise this country without delegitimising the ideas that raised it to greatness: personal autonomy, the rule of law, habeas corpus, representative government and free markets.\n\nWait until some more authoritarian alternative replaces the Anglosphere hegemony that we have lived under these past three centuries, comrades. Then you might understand the value of what it is you are tearing down.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.012498017783477,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Karl Marx\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"accomplish the annihilation of old Asiatic society, and the laying of the material foundations of Western society in Asia\",\n    \"message\": \"The British Empire must destroy traditional Asian society and establish the material basis for Western society in Asia.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Vladimir Lenin\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"RUS\",\n    \"quote\": \"capitalism has been transformed into imperialism\",\n    \"message\": \"Capitalism has evolved into imperialism, a new stage of its development.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Chinweizu\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"author\",\n    \"nationality\": \"NGA\",\n    \"quote\": \"White hordes have sallied forth from their western European homelands to assault, loot, occupy, rule and exploit the world\",\n    \"message\": \"Western European nations have extensively exploited and dominated the world through military force and colonial rule.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Frantz Fanon\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"socialist\",\n    \"nationality\": \"MTQ\",\n    \"quote\": \"The well-being and progress of Europe have been built up with the sweat and the dead bodies of Blacks, Arabs, Indians and the yellow races\",\n    \"message\": \"European prosperity and advancement are founded upon the forced labor and deaths of non-European peoples.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"The British Museum\",\n    \"organisation\": \"The British Museum\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"GBR\",\n    \"quote\": \"expansion of colonial power\",\n    \"message\": \"The carvings in question were acquired during a period of increasing colonial influence.\"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP"}],"createTime":"2025-10-15T10:37:04.052241Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"UHnvaJGYA6CcmecPh87QqQ0","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":428,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":428}],"promptTokenCount":2037,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":2037}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1303,"totalTokenCount":3768,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}}}

He sounds like a dedicated and hard-working MP who sacrificed a lot for his principles and to serve his country and community.\n\nBut it's only in dictatorships that devotion to \"the party\" starts to supersede commitment to moral and ethical principles. As citizens of a democratic country, it is imperative that we vote according to our principles and our ideas of what we want this country to be. Doing so must be based on a party's policies and actions, not its name or history. Granted, this is complicated by our voting system, which creates the sense that we must at times pick \"the best of a bad bunch\" as the only option of picking a winner.\n\nIt feels complicated for many of us, with good reason. But if Polly wants to walk into that voting booth and out of it with the same unambiguous pride in \"doing the right thing\" that her father instilled in her, the only way to do this is by holding firm to our principles and beliefs. Which party best represents those through its policies and actions remains up to the individual to decide.\n\nIf she worries about \"betraying\" her father by considering voting for a party other than Labour, she should consider if the betrayal to the leftwing principles and ideals her father dedicated his life to is really from her side, or from Labour's side. That should give her clarity.\n\nNadia Kevlin\n\nBristol\n\nPolly Hudson's father was clearly a dedicated politician, who worked tirelessly for his constituents (and later as a lord) to make the world a better place, while maintaining levels of humility in his work. Her love for, and dedication to him, is touching. If he had continued as an MP to this day I wonder whether he'd still be a member of the Labour party, while the two-child cap is still in place, and if he'd have held his tongue on the atrocities taking place in Gaza. Other fair-minded MPs have found themselves ejected from the party for refusing to ignore their conscience on these and other issues.\n\nUnfortunately, Hudson's unflinching commitment to Labour is, to this outsider, ultimately a case of the awful political tribalism that has held this country back for too long. Picasso is thought to have said that \"tradition is having a baby, not wearing your father's hat\". She could learn from him in this instance. The Labour party is not now the party that it was when her father represented it. Politicians and parties change, and her vote can too.\n\nTom Houston\n\nLondon\n\nLike Polly Hudson's old man, my mum was a Labour politician. Unlike Polly's old man, Mum did not have the privilege of going to grammar school, and did not become a well-connected journalist, let alone a well-paid MP and a member of the House of Lords. Instead, she transported sanitary bins back to PHS's cleaning yard and, in later life, drove around transporting quiches to restaurants from the type of white van that Emily Thornberry so unforgettably poked fun at years ago.\n\nMum's political career amounted to a few years as a councillor in south-east London, tirelessly supporting local people with local issues. She fell out with the local Labour party, became an independent, and was so well admired that she easily got re-elected. People over party, that was Mum. No sleaze scandals, no free clothes, no second house allowance - just a hard-working politician who helped people in need and was usually absent from my childhood when doing that.\n\nIn the years before Alzheimer's killed her, Mum became fearful and devastated by the untrammelled violence of this changing society. She was disillusioned with a Labour party that seemed to be less representative of her and more representative of the class of well-connected journalists and communications consultants.\n\nNo one in my family now votes Labour. I doubt they ever will again. Polly says she's not able to change her vote. She can, and should. If you're autonomous you vote based on what you believe, not what you're told.\n\nAshley Hyne\n\nFlint</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-5.285370201192876,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Polly Hudson\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"GBR\",\n    \"quote\": \"Some people have a choice about whether or not to vote Labour.

It came as part of a judgment that banned a planned pro-Palestine march to the Sydney Opera House scheduled for the weekend.\n\nBefore this, protesters, police, and even the courts, had consistently considered a court ruling prohibiting a protest did not mean the protest in itself was unlawful. It merely exposed a person to potentially being charged if they committed certain actions under the Summary Offences Act.\n\nFor example, if the courts prohibited a protest at a certain location, but people turned up anyway, they couldn't be charged unless they were obstructing traffic and ignored a move on order, were causing harm, or were near a place of worship.\n\nBut now a demonstrator's mere presence at a banned protest could expose them to being found in contempt of court if they're found to have knowledge of the court order, or potentially charged for knowingly joining an unlawful assembly.\n\nAdvocates are now raising concerns it could undermine the \"form 1\" system, which was initially set up to encourage the right to protest.\n\nUnder the regime introduced in NSW in 1979, protest organisers can apply to police ahead of time using a notice of intention to hold a public assembly - commonly known as a form 1. If police oppose the form 1, the supreme court has the final say over whether the protest will be \"authorised\" or \"prohibited\".\n\nSarah Schwartz, a legal director at the Human Rights Law Centre, said she fears the new ruling could deter people from using the system.\n\n\"It really means that people are now going to have to make a choice,\" she said.\n\n\"I would say it's kind of the opposite of having a system that facilitates peaceful protest because it means that there's an incentive now for people not to make an application under this system.\"\n\nAs one organiser told Guardian Australia: \"Why would I now risk turning a lawful right to assemble into an unlawful one?\"\n\nMeanwhile Stephen Blanks, a spokesperson for the NSW Civil Liberties Council, said he's concerned that the contempt of court risk extends not just to the defendants, but to everyone.\n\n\"It has never been contemplated in any case over the last 20 years that people who are not parties to these court proceedings could be subject to contempt of court,\" he said.\n\nHowever, the police say they don't expect it to lead to fewer form 1 applications.\n\n\"I think, by and large, people want to work with the police, and they want to get the outcome they want. They don't want the conflict, we don't want the conflict and we want to make sure people are safe,\" the assistant commissioner Peter McKenna told reporters shortly after the judgment was delivered.\n\nMcKenna had told reporters last week after police knocked back the Palestine Action Group's application to march to the Opera House that such decisions had only gone before the supreme court two or three times this year.\n\nOne of the protest groups that went before the court last year after the police knocked back their form 1 on safety grounds was Rising Tide.\n\nThe court sided with police, but the organisers went ahead with the protest anyway.\n\nThe police facilitated the protest, however confined it to an area so that it wouldn't disrupt the coal ships. After some people went outside the boundary in an attempt to try to stop the ships, 173 people were arrested and 130 were charged for blocking a major facility. Of those not charged, 29 were fined under the Marine Safety Act for obstructing a vessel, and 14 people aged under 18 were not charged.\n\nRising Tide will host their next blockade of the Newcastle Port in just over a month. Zack Schofield, a spokesperson for the group said they plan to submit a form 1 because they have been requested by the Newcastle city council to do so.\n\n\"We use the form 1 system to engage in good faith,\" he said.\n\nSchofield said it remained to be seen what the group would do this year if the court blocks them again.\n\nBut he said: \"If I or any other Rising Tide organiser are arrested for contempt of court or disobeying a prohibition order, we will appeal that decision on behalf of all Australians to the high court, because we believe it is fundamentally unconstitutional.\"\n\nWhether or not it could be found unconstitutional remains murky. Anne Twomey, a professor in constitutional law at the University of Sydney, said the implied freedom of political communication is not absolute.\n\n\"There is no breach of the implied freedom if the law is reasonably appropriate and adapted to achieve another legitimate end,\" she said.\n\nIn the case of the proposed Opera House march this weekend, for example, she said the court stressed the serious public safety concerns that would arise if the protest went ahead in that particular location.\n\n\"Public safety is a legitimate end which the courts have previously accepted as a ground for permitting limitations on political protests, as long as the limitations are proportionate,\" she said.\n\nJustice Stephen Free said when reading out the reasons to prohibit the Opera House march: \"The court further held that the risk to public safety associated with this public assembly was so significant that it would be irresponsible to allow the public assembly to proceed irrespective of the political significance of the event and the importance of freedom of political expression.\"\n\nThere are divergent views about the value of the form 1 system. The NSW Council for Civil Liberties has been urging the Minns government to scrap it, and it doesn't exist in Victoria.\n\nThe premier of Victoria, Jacinta Allen, has consistently pushed back on calls for the state to follow NSW in adopting it.\n\n\"In my mind that runs the risk of being a very lengthy, unwieldy, time-consuming process for both the police force and the court system and it does not give a guarantee that each and every event would be undertaken peacefully,\" Allan has previously said.\n\nGreens spokesperson for justice, Sue Higginson, says the system is useful, but only if its used in the way it was intended when it was first introduced: to facilitate genuine protests - particularly as protests escalate to reflect the scale of the issues they are trying to tackle, such as genocide and climate collapse.\n\nHigginson argued this was reflected in Justice Belinda Rigg's authorisation of the Palestine Action Group's march across the Sydney Harbour Bridge, which attracted an estimated 225,00 to 300,000 people.\n\nIn her judgment, Rigg said: \"The march at this location is motivated by the belief that the horror and urgency of the situation in Gaza demands an urgent and extraordinary response from the people of the world.\"</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.5098738484059073,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Sarah Schwartz\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Human Rights Law Centre\",\n    \"role\": \"Legal director\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"It really means that people are now going to have to make a choice.\",\n    \"message\": \"The new ruling by the New South Wales court of appeal, which criminalises attending a prohibited protest, compels people who organise demonstrations to make a difficult decision.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Sarah Schwartz\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Human Rights Law Centre\",\n    \"role\": \"Legal director\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"I would say it's kind of the opposite of having a system that facilitates peaceful protest because it means that there's an incentive now for people not to make an application under this system.\",\n    \"message\": \"The new ruling by the New South Wales court of appeal, which allows for criminalisation of attending 'prohibited' protests, contradicts the purpose of the 'form 1' system designed to encourage peaceful protest by discouraging its use.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"Protest Organiser\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"Why would I now risk turning a lawful right to assemble into an unlawful one?\",\n    \"message\": \"The new ruling by the New South Wales court of appeal makes protest organisers hesitant to apply for permits (form 1) because it risks criminalizing their otherwise lawful right to assemble.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Stephen Blanks\",\n    \"organisation\": \"NSW Civil Liberties Council\",\n    \"role\": \"Spokesperson\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"It has never been contemplated in any case over the last 20 years that people who are not parties to these court proceedings could be subject to contempt of court.\",\n    \"message\": \"It has been unprecedented for individuals who are not directly involved in court cases regarding protest prohibitions to face charges of contempt of court.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Peter McKenna\",\n    \"organisation\": \"New South Wales Police Force\",\n    \"role\": \"Assistant Commissioner\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"I think, by and large, people want to work with the police, and they want to get the outcome they want.

One speaker may have several quotes.\n\nInclude direct quotes only, do not include paraphrased quotes.\n\nHere is the article:\n\n\n<article>Everyone remembers where they were when the news broke. Like 9/11 or 7/7, October 7 is now etched in the collective memory - a day that seared itself into the soul of the Jewish people and, for those who still have moral sight, into that of the civilised world.\n\nToday, on the second-year anniversary, millions across the world will light candles and hold vigils today, remembering the slaughter of innocent Israelis, the families torn apart, the lives extinguished in terror.\n\nI remember watching those first fragments of footage on my phone - short, grainy clips on social media that defied belief. The confusion quickly gave way to horror as the scale became clear: kidnap, rape, beheadings, babies burnt alive, families wiped out. Hamas gunmen rampaging through homes and festivals, joined by Palestinian civilians eager to partake in the spoils. It was not resistance; it was savagery, planned and executed with chilling precision.\n\nIn government, the immediate response was to ensure the safety of Jewish communities here at home and to determine whether any Britons were among the dead or kidnapped. As home secretary, I had already increased the funding for CST - the Community Security Trust - earlier in the spring of 2023 because of rising anti-Semitism, and police presence had ramped up outside synagogues to support the Jewish community.\n\nBut, sickeningly, even before the facts had even settled - before the bodies had been counted, before all of the hostages' names were known - the marches began. While Israeli families searched for their children in the ruins, and while hostages were being dragged through tunnels in Gaza, thousands were gathering on the streets of London and Manchester. Flags were waved, slogans chanted - \"From the river to the sea\" echoing through our capital - all commencing weeks before Israel had even begun to defend itself.\n\nWhat was being expressed was not solidarity with Palestinians. It was something darker. The marches were not about policy or territory or proportionality. They were about hatred - hatred so raw that it celebrated Jewish death as political liberation.\n\nTwo years on, that hatred has not diminished; it has metastasised. The hate marches have grown from thousands to hundreds of thousands. Anti-Semitism - once whispered, once a source of national shame - now parades openly around the country, unpoliced and unashamed. Jewish families in London check the calendar before taking public transport, wondering if a protest might make it unsafe for them to travel that day.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police have become a tragic study in moral confusion - issuing apology after apology for their own failures, while deferring always to a mayor who seems more concerned with appeasing Left-wing militants in London than maintaining order. The result is two-tier policing: one standard for everyone else, another for the so-called \"protesters\" whose extremism must apparently be indulged. And those of us who called it out and fought to fix it? Vilified as \"divisive\" and \"Islamophobic\".\n\nFrom chants of \"Jihad\" on our streets to unprecedented anti-Semitism in the NHS, BBC and universities; from masked mobs scaling war memorials to the desecration of art and monuments - all of it has been tolerated, excused, normalised. The authorities shrug. Ministers mutter about \"un-British behaviour\", as if the problem were mere impoliteness. Meanwhile, Jewish blood is spilt in Manchester suburbs - the inevitable consequence of years of weakness and appeasement.\n\nAnd then, today of all days - on the second anniversary of October 7 - university campuses across Britain host events in \"honour\" of the so-called martyrs. At Sheffield, a \"Revolutionary Communist Party\" rally. In London, gatherings to mark \"Two Years of Resistance.\" This is not solidarity. It is moral sickness disguised as activism.\n\nWhere, one might ask, is our national sense of decency? When did we lose the ability to distinguish between right and wrong, victim and aggressor, civilisation and barbarism?\n\nThe answer lies in years of institutional cowardice - a refusal to enforce the law impartially, a political class too timid to confront Islamist intimidation, and a police force more frightened of upsetting Left-wing militants than hate preachers. Britain, a country once defined by moral courage, now bows before the mob.\n\nWhat we are witnessing is not protest but a moral inversion - a celebration of cruelty dressed up as compassion. The phrase \"hate marches\" once seemed a provocation. It now feels too mild. We should all hang our heads in shame.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-461.1656799316406,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"[]"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP"}],"createTime":"2025-10-15T10:37:04.091615Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"UHnvaN_LBeiAm9IP78e4iQY","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1}],"promptTokenCount":1316,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1316}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1075,"totalTokenCount":2392,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}}}

One speaker may have several quotes.\n\nInclude direct quotes only, do not include paraphrased quotes.\n\nHere is the article:\n\n\n<article>A leading Democrat, backed by substantial funding, should enter the 2028 presidential race right now\n\nThe Democratic politicians on the national scene, charged with leading the opposition, continue to bring a butterknife to the ongoing gunfight that is US politics under Donald Trump. Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, comes across as a weary grandpa, glasses perched halfway down his nose as he reads his script in sleep-inducing monotone. Quick - who's the minority leader of the House? You get bonus points if you can identify Hakeem Jeffries. Charismatic he is not.\n\nWhat's to be done?\n\nDemocrats cannot afford to play possum and wait for Trump to implode, as onetime political guru James Carville urged in a New York Times opinion piece. That won't be Trump's fate - his boast that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue without losing any voters isn't far off the mark.\n\nBarack Obama could go toe-to-toe with Trump. He's the most popular living president - a YouGov poll, taken just before the last election, showed that over half of all Americans would most likely vote for him. Although the two-term president can't run again, he'd garner the attention that Democrats badly need.\n\nBut the former president has had next to nothing to say about Trump's initiatives. While he has scolded Democratic politicians for not speaking out, he has gone silent. He hasn't appeared at any public event staged by opponents of the president. Instead, he's producing movies and documentaries, playing golf (as of 2016, he was an \"honest 13\") and building an $18m mansion in Hawaii.\n\nWhat's the alternative?\n\nSeveral presidential hopefuls have already hit the rubber-chicken circuit, making coy noises about their intentions for 2028, but that's not nearly good enough. These desperate times demand boldness. Here's my proposition: a leading Democrat, backed by substantial funding, should enter the 2028 presidential race right now.\n\nHear me out before you start laughing.\n\nFor starters, the reign of the ancien regime and its timid successors like Kamala Harris is finally over. That's the message delivered by 33-year-old Zohran Mamdani, who trounced septuagenarian Andrew Cuomo, avatar of the past, in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary. Whoever runs for president should take a leaf from Mamdani's playbook. No more tedious, repetitious TV ads. It is essential to reach voters where they are, knocking on doors, listening to what they say about what matters to them, then turning out a stream of TikTok and Instagram videos, delivering messages that resonate.\n\nGoodbye to laundry lists of forgettable nostrums, like the multipoint policy plans that Harris lugged around. My ideal candidate must have the skill to communicate ideas - bold ideas, not small-bore suggestions - in a non-wonky way. As former New York governor Mario Cuomo memorably put it: \"You campaign in poetry. You govern in prose.\"\n\nWhile it's hard to imagine any Democrat winning over the Maga diehards, Republican voters who held their noses and voted for Trump could be swayed by someone who concentrated on meat-and-potato issues, pledging to build millions of units of affordable housing, deliver universal preschool and affordable healthcare, picking up the bill with a fair tax law. That was Mamdani's message, and a considerable number of Trump backers voted for him after hearing his pitch.\n\nMy candidate should be prepared to take on some of the Democratic Party's sacred cows. Assailing Israel for the war crimes committed in Gaza comes to mind.\n\nThe toughest hurdle is raising enough money to be taken seriously, but it isn't impossible. Billionaires including Democratic megadonor George Soros, Bill Gates, eBay founder Pierre Omidyar and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman recently formed a group called Billionaires Against Billionaires to do battle with Trump's coterie of billionaires. Imagine the impact if these megadonors join forces with grassroots groups nationwide.\n\nThe Democratic Party has a deep bench, and there's no shortage of politicians who could fill the bill. Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, former transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro, Arizona senator Ruben Gallego and Kentucky governor Andy Beshear are among those who come to mind. And while the first profile-in-courage candidate will have first-mover advantage, others may well enter the fray.\n\nLet's be clear - there isn't a candidate, no matter how artful, who has a prayer of dislodging Trump from his imperial perch. But the presidential hopeful who decides that now is the time to present themself as a genuine alternative will attract attention, and right now, attention is what matters most. Unless someone steps up - and improbable as this scenario is, I haven't come up with a better alternative - the Democrats will be giving Trump a free pass for the next three-and-a-half years.

The release of the hostages is set to occur prior to Monday morning; a commitment to the terror group's disarming has yet to be secured. For now, though, the mood in Israel and Palestine is celebratory: for the first time since the horror of October 7, a long-term peace deal is in sight.\n\nOn the streets of London, however, the mood of the regular pro-Palestine protesters was unchanged. One organiser stated that the ceasefire was \"not a plan for an enduring peace\" as it \"says nothing about the root causes of violence\". Many of those attending made it quite clear what they believed those root causes to be: the existence of Israel.\n\nProtesters repeated the \"from the river to the sea\" slogan calling for the destruction of the Jewish state as police ushered away people carrying placards reading \"we stand with Britain's Jews\". Crowds chanted \"Israel is a terror state\"; an interviewee stated the protest was \"a bigger thing about who controls the world\", appearing to recycle old anti-Semitic tropes; placards showed Netanyahu manipulating Sir Keir Starmer and read \"Intifada until victory\"; voices called out \"death to the IDF\".\n\nOn paper, at least, much of what these protesters purported to want has been achieved. The IDF has partially withdrawn from Gaza. The conflict is set to come to an end. There is a roadmap, however tenuous, to a flourishing Palestine, with the backing of both Israel and Arab states.\n\nThat the streets of London can be filled with people calling for the destruction of Israel, accusing the Jewish state of genocide, at precisely the point at which it is voluntarily giving up its overwhelmingly successful military campaign in the hope of finding a route to long-lasting peace and coexistence illustrates that the \"root causes\" for many protesters is unlikely to be the current conflict at all.\n\nIf all of the tens of thousands of people marching on the capital's streets were motivated uniformly by a desire for peace, the tenor would be completely different: there would be celebration of the ceasefire, calls for Hamas to disarm so the deal can progress, jubilation at the release of hostages.\n\nInstead, we hear \"death to the IDF\", \"from the river to the sea\"; calls, at their core, for more dead Jews, the continuation of the intifada, the unending war until the destruction of the state of Israel. To call these elements pro-Palestinian is a fundamental misreading of their nature. For all too many involved, these protests and their motives would appear instead to be anti-Israel, an expression of hatred rather than a call for peace.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.2632520978355044,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"One organiser\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"organiser\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"not a plan for an enduring peace\\\" as it \\\"says nothing about the root causes of violence\",\n    \"message\": \"The current ceasefire is not a plan for a lasting peace because it does not address the fundamental reasons for the conflict.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Protesters\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"from the river to the sea\",\n    \"message\": \"The slogan 'from the river to the sea' calls for the destruction of the Jewish state of Israel, referring to the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"People carrying placards\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"we stand with Britain's Jews\",\n    \"message\": \"We express our solidarity and support for the Jewish people in Britain.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Crowds\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"Israel is a terror state\",\n    \"message\": \"Israel is a state that engages in terrorism.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"an interviewee\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"a bigger thing about who controls the world\",\n    \"message\": \"The ongoing protest is not merely about the conflict in the Middle East but represents a larger issue concerning global power dynamics and control.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Protesters\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"Intifada until victory\",\n    \"message\": \"The uprising, or Intifada, against Israel will continue until complete victory is achieved.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Voices\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"death to the IDF\",\n    \"message\": \"There should be an end to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).\"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP"}],"createTime":"2025-10-15T10:37:04.057141Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"UHnvaLW-A7i6ld8PyJ_H8Qk","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":523,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":523}],"promptTokenCount":949,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":949}],"thoughtsTokenCount":2918,"totalTokenCount":4390,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}}}

An incredible feat that will go down in history. NOBEL PEACE PRIZE!\" Moreno added.\n\nBrian Mast, a Florida representative who once served as a civilian volunteer in the Israeli military, and wore his old Israeli uniform to work in the aftermath of the 7 October 2021 Hamas-led attack, also praised Trump.\n\n\"President Trump just did what career diplomats never could - he brought the world closer than it's ever been to peace in Gaza,\" Mast, who chairs the House foreign affairs committee, wrote. \"This deal only works if Hamas follows through. We don't trust terrorists, we trust results.\"\n\nWhile the US lawmakers did not mention the suffering of the Palestinian people, and the exact terms of the agreement remain unknown, a senior Qatari official said on social media that it also includes the release of Palestinian prisoners and the entry of aid.\n\nStill, Mosab Abu Toha, a Palestinian poet who won a 2025 Pulitzer prize for his New Yorker essays about Gaza and is now living in Syracuse, New York, expressed trepidation.\n\n\"Trump officially announces that Hamas and Israel signed off the first phase of 'Peace Plan.' To be honest, I do not like the language here,\" Abu Toha wrote on social media. \"The agreement signed should be emphatically about a permanent ceasefire. No more slaughtering of more Palestinians. It must not take phases to end a genocide. This is not truly anything close to peace! To me, it sounds like a pause of bloodshed for a few days or weeks!\"\n\n\"I'm old enough to remember the first phase of the previous 'ceasefire deal' in January this year,\" he added.\n\nThere was caution too from Yousef Munayyer, a Palestinian American who leads the Palestine/Israel program at Arab Center Washington DC. \"Very likely scenario moving forward,\" he wrote on X. \"1 Trump gets his Nobel Friday 2 Israel gets it's captives back Saturday 3 Genocide continues Sunday.\"\n\nShibley Telhami, a Palestinian American who is the Anwar Sadat professor for peace and development at the University of Maryland, scoffed at the idea that Trump deserves to be awarded the Nobel peace prize this week.\n\nThe agreement Trump announced on Wednesday \"would be very welcome, especially if it includes full ceasefire and flood of badly needed Gaza aid\", Telhami wrote. \"But so much remains unclear, even about first phase, including point of Israeli withdrawal. Key will be measures agreed to assure that first phase doesn't become last phase.\"\n\n\"While ending carnage is badly needed, Keep in mind: Gaza is obliterated, 10% of its population killed or wounded, possibly more, with overwhelming majority rendered homeless. Could take decades just to build what has been destroyed - and that's assuming killing has really ended,\" the scholar, who was born into a family of Palestinian Christians outside Haifa, added.\n\n\"Agreement is welcome, but 'peacemakers' don't enable war crimes, including the killing of thousands of children, for most of a year, then expect Nobel prize when a ceasefire is finally achieved,\" Telhami observed. \"Italy's PM has been referred to the ICC for much lesser enablement of war crimes.\"\n\nThe Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, said on Tuesday that she had been reported to the international criminal court for alleged complicity in genocide in connection with support for Israel's offensive in Gaza.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.7949922303895692,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Joni Ernst\",\n    \"organisation\": \"US Senate\",\n    \"role\": \"Senator for Iowa\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"President Trump is the peace president!

One speaker may have several quotes.\n\nInclude direct quotes only, do not include paraphrased quotes.\n\nHere is the article:\n\n\n<article>Kushner and Witkoff have made progress by remembering national interests, not virtue-signalling to international counterparts\n\nThe events in the Middle East this week have been truly extraordinary. In themselves, they are remarkable enough - a real hope of the Gaza war ending, and the return of the Israeli hostages, are wonderful things. But the way in which the Trump administration has gone about handling foreign affairs has upended conventional wisdom. The Trump approach is reaping enormous results, and is worthy of deep reflection.\n\nThe essay question is a simple but stark one. How is it that a brash New York property tycoon, aided by two more New York real estate businessmen, has been able to succeed on the world stage where the most lettered of men, the most experienced career diplomats, have failed repeatedly?\n\nFor too long, generations of foreign policy makers have become more focused on virtue signalling to counterparts in international organisations, or a domestic base, than on solving problems and working in their national interest. In an excellent recent book on exactly this topic, the academic Philip Cunliffe laments the impact that these internationalist negotiators have had:\n\n\"International harmonisation dissolved away distinctive national interests. Nation states completed the transition to member states, no longer defined by the nations they claimed to represent, but instead by the global organizations of which they were a part.\"\n\nThis sounds like a perfect diagnosis based on my experience. The arch proponent of this was Barack Obama, whose soaring rhetoric tried to hide the fact that America was weakened on the world stage. His efforts to \"lead from behind\" emboldened the adversaries of the West, as did those of his successor Joe Biden. Many of the same people who staffed the Obama State Department returned under Biden, including Tony Blinken. They felt it beneath their dignity to knock heads together and push for any actual concrete outcomes.\n\nIn the first Trump term, Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law, was widely mocked for citing, as evidence of his qualifications to work on peace in the Middle East, that he had read 25 books on the subject.\n\nBut by treating all parties as honest brokers, and above all staying cognisant of their respective national interests, Kushner was able, along with my friend Abdullah bin Zayed of the United Arab Emirates and many others, to craft the Abraham Accords. This deal, normalising relations between Israel and several other players in the region, was the most successful foreign policy achievement in decades.\n\nUntil now.\n\nBecause now Kushner, along with yet another New York real estate mogul, Steve Witkoff, has seemingly sealed a deal between Hamas and Israel that has seen all the remaining hostages returned, and brings the end of two awful years of war much closer. This could lead to the next stage of the Abraham Accords, the normalisation of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia: yet another seismic move (and something the October 7 atrocities were probably designed, in part, to prevent). This will inevitably focus Iranian leaders' minds on which future they want for their increasingly isolated nation. The path to a peaceful Middle East could be opening up. Not bad for a couple of businessmen with \"no experience\" in foreign policy.\n\nAlongside the Trump White House's successful efforts over India vs Pakistan, Armenia vs Azerbaijan, and many others, this is already a remarkably successful Presidency. Managing to pull off the same trick with Ukraine and Russia would make Donald Trump a hero across almost every continent, and allow the USA to focus on its main strategic threat (and yes, Keir, enemy) - China.\n\nWhen his predecessor, Theodore Roosevelt, brokered peace in the Japan-Russia conflict in the early 1900s, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Watch this space for 2026.\n\nIt is crucial to understand why this has been the case if we are to rebuild a British foreign policy fit for the future, as Keir Starmer's increasingly wobbly premiership falls apart. British kowtowing to China over the Chagos Islands and the collapse of the spying trial has left us looking pathetic.\n\nFor those in the opposition parties who want to start to understand what a proper UK foreign policy should look like, there are many great recent works by British thinkers. I recommend former No 10 adviser John Bew's book on 19 century Foreign Secretary Viscount Castlereagh, Niall Ferguson's writings on the Free Press and beyond, or Dominic Cummings' dazzling 400-page blog post on Bismarck's life and actions.\n\nBut these aside, we should learn the crucial lesson of our time. Outsiders with real world experience, talented businessmen with high agency, and an acute awareness of the national interest (both their own and other nations') can change the affairs of the world, rather than just go with the flow of conventional diplomacy. If this doesn't cause some deep soul-searching and change in the Foreign Office and other traditional sources of negotiating talent, then the next government should just sideline the diplomatic grandees and look to bring in outsiders who appreciate the art of the deal.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.8318875456509525,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Philip Cunliffe\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"academic\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"International harmonisation dissolved away distinctive national interests.

The third-year student at King's College London said it was \"really important that we show our presence today\", as protesters chanted \"free Palestine\" and \"Israel is a terror state\".\n\nThe protests came days after a terrorist incident at a north Manchester synagogue in which Yom Kippur worshippers Melvin Cravitz, 66 and Adrian Daulby, 53, were killed. Jihad al-Shamie, 35, was shot dead at the scene after using a knife and a car to attack worshippers.\n\n\"It's completely separate,\" said Ali, who is Muslim and grew up in Tower Hamlets, east London. \"What happened in Manchester was abhorrent but I don't think that should silence the protesters.\"\n\nWhile there were Jewish protesters present on Tuesday in support of the march as well as against, the Jewish Leadership Council said there were no memorial events planned for the day, which had instead taken place on the weekend as the anniversary coincided with Sukkot, a seven-day Jewish holiday that commemorates the exodus of Jews from Egypt 3,200 years ago.\n\nAmong the protesters was Leopold Berger, 24, from the Netherlands. He heard the protest from class at LSE, put on his keffiyeh and Palestinian football jersey and joined in.\n\nResponding to Starmer's description in the Times of the protests as \"un-British\", he added: \"One day it'll be British to be for a pro-Palestinian state ... but right now it isn't. These things fluctuate based on national identity or what the government decides is in their national interests.\"\n\nIn Scotland, the University of Glasgow said it \"abhors the glorification of violence\" after a post on a student group's Instagram appeared to celebrate the Hamas attacks.\n\n\"Whilst we commemorate two years of genocide ... we celebrate the glorious Al-Aqsa Flood,\" a post promoting the \"student intifada\" said on the Glasgow University Justice for Palestine Society's Instagram page.\n\nAt lunchtime, Glasgow students sat in the campus cloisters chanting \"stop the bombing\", while in Edinburgh students gathered with homemade placards, some with the controversial slogan \"from the river to the sea Palestine will be free\", in an event that attracted hundreds, including staff.\n\nLouis Danker, a recent Edinburgh graduate and president of the Union of Jewish Students, said: \"While we respect the right to protest, we are deeply disappointed at the time, place and manner of today's demonstrations.\n\n\"Jewish students are seeking space to mourn their loved ones killed two years ago, and should never have to stand by as their peers glorify that day. We've been warning that violent language breeds violent acts, as we tragically saw in Manchester last week.\"\n\nAmina was among students at Strathclyde student who gathered at Rottenrow Gardens in Glasgow waving Palestinian flags in defiance of the university's request that they postpone the event out of \"common decency\". Speaking of Starmer's pleas, she countered: \"The genocide is not stopping today.\"\n\nThey were scenes senior politicians had been desperate to avoid. Speaking to Sky News, Phillipson had urged students to \"pause\", \"show some humanity\" and \"understand the deep sense of loss\" people felt on 7 October.\n\nMeanwhile, Badenoch, the Conservative leader, said: \"The same hatred that fuelled those barbaric attacks still festers today. We see it in the so-called 'protests' that turn into hate marches on our streets.\"\n\nJenrick, the shadow justice secretary, called the events a \"fucking disgrace\" at a Conservative party conference fringe event.\n\nShabana Mahmood, the home secretary, previously said repeated large-scale protests caused \"considerable fear\" for the Jewish community, pledging to give police greater powers to restrict protests.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.0175487231182796,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"The German student\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"Student\",\n    \"nationality\": \"DEU\",\n    \"quote\": \"I'm not showing my support for the Israeli government or the war in Gaza but just for the Israeli people who have gone through something so, so terrible two years ago.

Even as Air Force One touched down in Tel Aviv the 20 remaining hostages were being released, the crowds had gathered to chant his name and the Knesset was preparing to greet him as a hero like no other. It was a sweet moment for the American president but mostly for the families of the hostages still living after 738 days in captivity. The scenes of their emotional homecoming will be the abiding memory of the day.\n\nIt is easy for those outside the Middle East to forget the weight of faith and history on the region but yesterday's events certainly reminded us of them. Speakers in the Israeli parliament quoted the Book of Genesis, compared Mr Trump to Cyrus the Great who freed the Jews from Babylon, and peppered their addresses with references to Joshua, David, the Maccabees and other ancient figures and institutions.\n\nMoreover, anyone who thought Israel was isolated and cowed by international condemnation of their action in Gaza must have been astonished by the self-confidence and optimism on display in the Knesset.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu was lauded even if his handling of the crisis has not won universal approval in his homeland. The opposition leader Yair Lapid attacked those who had demonstrated weekly in cities like London against Israel, saying they had been deceived into believing there had been genocide and the intentional starvation of Palestinians.\n\nMr Trump asserted that Iran - the one big player not involved in yesterday's events - had been permanently prevented from developing a nuclear weapon. He said a peace deal with Tehran \"would be nice\" and hinted that he would make an attempt to do that soon. \"But first we have got to get Russia done, and we will get it done,\" he said.\n\nEven by Mr Trump's standards this was a hubristic tour de force. \"This is the dawn of a new Middle East,\" he said. Would that this were true. History suggests it is far too premature to make such a declaration; but after the effort he has put in, Mr Trump was entitled to hope.\n\nThe president then headed to Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt for a summit involving more than 20 western and Arab leaders to lay the foundations for the future of Gaza and the rest of the region. He wants to rekindle the Abraham Accords, a lasting peace between the Arab nations and Israel.

He said rival \"political forces\" were \"solely responsible for this chaos\" after they \"instigated the destabilisation\" of the prime minister, Sébastien Lecornu.\n\nLecornu, a Macron ally, held his first meeting with France's new government after he appointed a mix of stalwarts from Macron's centrist grouping, as well as a few faces from the upper ranks of the civil service and civil society. New arrivals included Jean-Pierre Farandou, who headed the state-run railway, SNCF, and is now labour minister.\n\nLaurent Nuñez, who served as a junior minister in the interior ministry during the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) protests of 2018 and 2019, was appointed to the key post of interior minister. He had recently served as Paris police chief, where he had been responsible for the policing of last year's Olympic Games.\n\nIt is France's second government in a week: Lecornu's first government collapsed after only 14 hours amid backlash over a lack of fresh faces, and he dramatically resigned last Monday. Lecornu was then reappointed by Macron on Friday night and quickly assembled a new administration on Sunday. \"How long will it last?\" several regional newspapers asked, including La Provence in the south and La République du Centre.\n\nFrance has lurched from crisis to crisis since Macron's gamble on an inconclusive snap election last year. Parliament remains divided between the three blocs: the left, the far right and the centre, with no clear majority.\n\nSome parties have called on Macron to resign. \"Never forget that the mandate given by the French people is to serve, to serve and serve, and to provide answers to the questions of everyday French people, and to do everything possible for the independence of France,\" Macron told reporters in Egypt. That is the only thing that matters. The rest is the government's business ... I will continue to ensure stability.\"\n\nMacron's term ends in spring 2027. He declined to speculate on a possible dissolution of parliament and snap election if the latest government fails. \"I'm not making any bets,\" he said. \"I want the country to move forward.\"\n\nLecornu faces the urgent and complex task of getting a 2026 budget through parliament by the end of the year. He told ministers: \"Our only task is to surpass the political crisis.\" He said that political crisis was exasperating French people and observers worldwide. He called on the government to \"put egos aside\" and work collegiately to find compromise.\n\nLecornu will deliver his first key policy speech to the French parliament on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe leftwing La France Insoumise party and the far-right National Rally are due to put down motions for a no-confidence vote. For the government to be toppled, several opposition parties would have to group together to back a no-confidence vote, including the Socialists.\n\nThe Socialist party has said it will wait to hear Lecornu's policy speech before deciding. It has warned it could vote against the government unless Lecornu suspends Macron's controversial 2023 law that installed a gradual rise in the retirement age from 62 to 64.\n\nThe new cabinet is expected to present a draft budget on Tuesday morning that will include cuts on public spending.

Two years of genocide and our institutions remain complicit.\" It calls for a walkout of classes at 2pm, with the route taking in King's College London (KCL), the London School of Economics, University College London and finishing at SOAS.\n\nOther 7 October events have been advertised at the University of Sheffield, where the Revolutionary Communist party is staging a \"rally for Palestine\", KCL Students for Justice for Palestine has an evening of debate and discussion called \"Why it didn't start on October 7th\", while the Palestine Solidarity Society at Strathclyde University is staging a \"Protest 4 Palestine\".\n\nStern said there has been a \"deeply concerning\" rise in antisemitic incidents in the last two years. \"UUK has worked closely with university leaders to tackle this.\" She urged university leaders to maintain close contact with Jewish student groups and to publicise mechanisms for reporting antisemitic incidents.\n\n\"We have signposted resources to help universities combat antisemitism both from Universities UK and from the Community Security Trust and the Union of Jewish Students,\" she added.\n\nLouis Danker, the president of the Union of Jewish Students, said: \"We respect the right to protest and the importance of free speech within the law.

There were other parallels in their stories: Corrie was protesting against the demolition of a Palestinian family's home in Rafah when a soldier drove over her; Eygi was at a protest against settlement expansion near Nablus. Both had traveled to the region with the International Solidarity Movement, a group that for years has brought foreign activists to stand with Palestinians against Israel's occupation. An Israeli military investigation concluded that it was \"highly likely\" Eygi was hit \"indirectly and unintentionally by IDF fire which was not aimed at her\"; the Israeli military said that Corrie's death was an accident and that she was responsible for it.\n\nCindy and Craig Corrie pulled over at a highway rest stop when they got the call. \"There's really not much you can tell somebody,\" Cindy told the Guardian in an interview recalling her first conversation with Eygi's parents. \"I told them all I was trying to do was hug them through the phone.\"\n\nSince Rachel Corrie's killing in 2003, about a dozen US citizens are known to have died at the hands of Israeli soldiers or settlers, or while in Israeli custody. At least six were killed in the West Bank alone since Hamas's 7 October 2023 attacks and Israel's ensuing war in Gaza.\n\nMore than 40 US citizens were killed by Hamas in Israel on 7 October 2023, or after being taken hostage into Gaza. In those cases, the US justice department launched investigations and brought terrorism charges against the Hamas leaders it determined to be responsible, with attorney general Merrick Garland pledging that the US government would investigate \"each and every one of Hamas' brutal murders of Americans\".\n\nBut when it comes to killings by Israeli forces, the US government has consistently deferred to the Israeli military's own investigations, which Israeli rights groups have for years condemned as a \"whitewash\" . Rights groups have found that Israeli forces are almost never held accountable by the Israeli legal system when they harm Palestinians.\n\nTo date, nobody has been charged or held accountable for any of the deaths of US citizens at Israeli hands. A spokesperson for the state department said in a statement to the Guardian that the department offers consular assistance to the families of citizens killed overseas; it declined to comment on individual cases citing \"privacy and other considerations\". The spokesperson referred questions about the investigation of US citizens' killings to the justice department. A spokesperson for the justice department declined to respond to a detailed list of questions from the Guardian, citing the government shutdown.\n\nLast month, the Corries joined a group united by grief and purpose for a series of meetings in Washington DC, to demand the US government investigate their loved ones' killings. Eygi's sister, Özden Bennett, and her husband, Hamid Ali, were there. So were the fathers of Tawfic Abdel Jabbar, a 17-year-old from Louisiana who was shot at least 10 times while driving his car in the West Bank in 2024, and of Sayfollah Musallet, a 20-year-old from Florida who witnesses say was beaten to death by Israeli settlers in July. (Israel claims Jabbar was suspected of stone throwing, an account contradicted by an investigation by the Israeli rights group B'Tselem. After Musallet's killing, Israeli police arrested three settlers, but later released them. Israeli police did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for the IDF said that an investigation of the incident is ongoing.\n\nKamel Musallet, Sayfollah's father, told legislators that his son, an ice-cream shop owner from Tampa who had traveled to the West Bank to visit family, often boasted to his friends about his \"blue\" passport. \"He used to say, don't worry, we are Americans,\" said Musallet. \"He felt safer.\"\n\nBut it turns out American citizenship offers little protection. Musallet was killed in al-Mazra'a ash-Sharqiya, a relatively wealthy village north of Ramallah home to a population of Palestinian Americans so large some have taken to call it the \"Miami of the West Bank\".\n\nOne of the first people to reach his body was Hafeth Jabbar, the father of Tawfic. \"This is what we are dealing with every day,\" Jabbar told representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts in a meeting. On his phone, he showed her videos of settlers attacking his land, and a photo of one of the men who he believes shot his son. \"We're in a climate that does not see the humanity of people.\"\n\nAt a private dinner at a Balkan restaurant before three days of meetings with legislators, the families bonded over their shared grief and fears their loved ones' deaths would go unpunished - and that the impunity would lead to more killings. Ali, Eygi's husband, recalled with a smile that when he had first spoken to the Corries, Craig had called the families an exclusive \"club nobody wanted to be a part of\".\n\nThe meetings - with more than a dozen congressmen and senators - along with a press conference on Capitol Hill attended by several legislators, underscored a gradual shift in Congress on Israel over the last two years: a measured reflection of a more tectonic shift on Israel in American society more broadly. In an op-ed published just minutes before he sat down with the families, Bernie Sanders from Vermont became the first US senator to accuse Israel of committing genocide in Gaza. And days after meeting with them, senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon, joined by several colleagues, introduced a resolution calling on the US government to recognize a Palestinian state - another first.\n\nWhile Gaza has been more prominent in headlines, Israeli military and settler violence in the West Bank has also spiked since 7 October - with more Palestinians killed in the last two years than at any point since the second intifada in the early 2000s.\n\n\"Since Hamas' horrific attack on October 7th, there has been a massive increase in settlers harassing Palestinians in the West Bank: blocking access to water, vineyards, and olive orchards, and threatening and assaulting Palestinian villagers as they go about daily tasks,\" Merkley said in a statement to the Guardian after a meeting with the families and senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, with whom he recently traveled to the West Bank.\n\n\"This rising violence is unacceptable, and so too is the lack of justice for these families from the Netanyahu government,\" Merkley added. \"As Israel's close ally, the US government must do more to ensure accountability for those impacted.\"\n\nWhile the changes in Congress have been subtle, and US government support for Israel remains largely unchanged, the shift in public opinion has been more significant. More than half of US adults hold unfavourable opinions of Israel, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey, compared with 42% before the war started.\n\nThe US justice department can exert jurisdiction over the killings of US citizens abroad but normally does so with the consent and assistance of authorities of the relevant country. It's rare for US civilians abroad to be killed by a state's own security forces. Israel has become an exception.\n\n\"When Americans are killed abroad, it's a standard procedure for our US government to open an investigation,\" representative Rashida Tlaib said at the families' press conference. \"But when murderers wear Israeli uniforms, there's complete silence. Not only that, they ask the actual government that committed the crime to do the investigation.\"\n\nThe Corries spent years after Rachel's killing trying to get the US government to open an independent investigation, lobbying legislators on countless trips to the capital in a futile crusade I documented a few years ago. After losing a years-long legal battle against the Israeli government, and another in the US against bulldozer manufacturer Caterpillar, the family eventually gave up. They resumed their advocacy after the 2022 killing of journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, who was shot in the head while reporting in the West Bank city of Jenin. The IDF has apologized for the killing.\n\nAbu Akleh's death is the only killing of a US citizen by Israeli forces over which the FBI is understood to have launched a formal investigation. (Although the FBI has interviewed witnesses, sources say, the US justice department never publicly confirmed the existence of the investigation, which appears to have stalled.)\n\nIn their meetings with legislators, the families repeatedly pointed to the US government's response to the killing of Americans in the 7 October attacks, lamenting the double standard and warning that continued impunity all but ensured more killings to come. They also coalesced around a demand that US legislators apply more pressure on Israel to release Mohammed Ibrahim, a 16-year-old American Palestinian boy - and Sayfollah Musallet's cousin - who has been held in Israeli military prison for more than seven months over allegations of stone throwing.\n\n\"If there had been any accountability in Rachel's case some of these families wouldn't be here,\" Cindy Corrie said in a meeting with senator Peter Welch of Vermont. \"And yet, here we are again,\" her husband added.\n\nOver tea at a congressional cafeteria, Cindy Corrie said she has tried to be \"honest\" about the path ahead when speaking to the Eygis. If history is any indication, their calls for justice may lead to nothing.\n\nBut she also recognized a perceptible shift, on the hill and off. \"The climate in 2003 around this issue was very different,\" she said.\n\nIn their early meetings in Congress, the Corries recalled, they would often show up to congressional offices with maps showing where Gaza was. Few legislators were willing to publicly criticize Israel at the time, and some were dismissive of the Corries and even hostile.\n\nNow things are different: within days of Eygi's killing, more than 100 legislators called on the Biden administration to launch an independent investigation. In Washington, Eygi's husband was stopped at a Mexican restaurant by a woman wearing a keffiyeh who recognized the activist on a pin he was wearing. A security guard at one of the congressional buildings where the family met with legislators also recognized Eygi on a pin her sister was wearing.\n\n\"I'm sorry about your loss. I hope that they listen to you,\" he told her. She handed him a pin.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.3081350834411982,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Cindy Corrie\",\n

It has also watched its other key ally, Iran, see parts of its military and economic infrastructure repeatedly battered by Israeli strikes.\n\nDespite years of cultivating ties with the Palestinian Authority and hosting Hamas delegations for talks in Moscow, Russia played no tangible role in the negotiations that produced the Gaza ceasefire.\n\nBy largely siding with the Palestinians and moving closer to Iran, Putin has strained his once warm relationship with Benjamin Netanyahu. Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said last month that Israel had transferred a Patriot missile system to Kyiv.\n\nIn public Russia's elites have praised Trump's efforts to end the war in Gaza, part of a broader charm offensive aimed at currying favour with the US leader.\n\nPutin said last Friday that he had offered to postpone his own Russia-Arab world summit \"so as not to interfere\" with Trump's initiative, and lauded the US-led push to end the war in Gaza.\n\n\"If Trump succeeds in accomplishing everything he set out to do, it would be a truly historic event,\" he told reporters during a visit to Tajikistan.\n\nStill, frustration has seeped through among senior Russian officials at being sidelined.\n\nThe veteran foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Monday that while Russia \"would not refuse to take part in Middle East settlement efforts if invited\", the Kremlin was not going to \"impose its services\".\n\nThere was also open criticism of Trump's deal.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the hawkish former president and now deputy chair of Russia's Security Council, dismissed it as meaningless.\n\n\"Releasing Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners is a good thing, of course, but it will not solve anything,\" he said. \"Until a full-fledged Palestinian state is established in line with the well-known UN resolutions, nothing will change. The war will continue. Everyone understands this.\"\n\nRussia's retreat from global influence reaches beyond the Middle East.\n\nAcross Central Asia and the Caucasus, states once seen as loyal satellites - including Kazakhstan, Armenia and Azerbaijan - are steadily drifting out of Moscow's orbit, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine has forced them to reassess the potential risks to their own security.\n\nIn August, Trump hosted the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan at the White House after mediating a peace deal between them.\n\nThe agreement granted Washington exclusive rights to develop the so-called Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity, a corridor cutting through Armenia to link Azerbaijan with its Nakhchivan exclave on the Turkish border.\n\nTellingly, both the Armenian prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, and Azerbaijan's president, Ilham Aliyev, travelled to Egypt on Monday.\n\nPutin will have another opportunity to host leaders from the Arab world, with the Kremlin indicating that the summit is likely to be rescheduled for November.\n\n\"A summit serves to reinforces Russia's message that it is not isolated outside the west,\" said Notte. \"It matters symbolically for Moscow, but it doesn't restore Russia's role as a major player in the region.\"</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.2725615905918621,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Hanna Notte\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"Expert on Russian foreign policy\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"Russia's diplomatic role in the Middle East has declined as a result of the Ukraine war.

The faces of hostages still held in Gaza are plastered on bus stops around the country, and homes that were lit on fire by militants as they marauded through kibbutzim stand charred and abandoned.\n\nHundreds of survivors of the attack on the Nova music festival attended a memorial on Sunday with former hostages and the families of victims.\n\n\"This angel would have been 27 today. I live the memory as if it were an hour ago,\" Ofir Dor, whose son Idan Dor was killed at the festival, said while standing under a memorial showing victims' faces.\n\nThe anniversary has been overshadowed by hopes that the war in Gaza may finally be coming to a close. Negotiators from Hamas and Israel gathered in Egypt on Monday where they began indirect talks to iron out the details of the release of all hostages held in Gaza and the return of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, as well as the initial withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.\n\nThis round of negotiations, while still far from a deal, has generated more enthusiasm than any peace efforts since the last ceasefire broke down in mid-March.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu has said he hopes to announce the release of hostages \"in the coming days\", while Donald Trump has threatened Hamas with \"total obliteration\" if the deal does not happen.\n\nSome commemoration events have been repurposed to rallies to call on the government to reach a deal to bring the hostages home and end the war. At a rally in Hostage Square in Tel Aviv on Saturday night, families demanded Netanyahu agree to Trump's plan to end the war in Gaza.\n\nIn Gaza, Palestinians are waiting with bated breath to see if a ceasefire materialises. Despite Trump's demands that Israel stop bombing Gaza in anticipation of a hostage release, strikes on the strip have continued. Gaza's ministry of health said at least 19 people were killed by Israel over the last 24 hours, including two people seeking aid.\n\nTuesday will also mark the second anniversary of the start of Israel's military campaign on the Gaza Strip, which has brought material and human destruction to the people living there.\n\nMore than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed and about 170,000 have been wounded by Israel in Gaza, according to the Gaza health ministry. At least 460 people have died from starvation in Gaza, and the world's leading authority on food crises has said a famine is unfolding in parts of the strip - a product of what most aid agencies say is an Israeli blockade on Gaza. Israel has denied the claim.\n\nA UN commission of inquiry, several human rights groups and the world's premier association of genocide scholars have said Israel has committed genocide in Gaza over the past two years. Israel has denied the accusation and said its actions constitute self-defence.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-4.3117308099585845,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Ofir Dor\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"This angel would have been 27 today.

One speaker may have several quotes.\n\nInclude direct quotes only, do not include paraphrased quotes.\n\nHere is the article:\n\n\n<article>After decades of being dismissed as fringe, the boycott call has been taken up by leading figures across arts, sports and politics\n\nFor more than a decade Shouk offered an Israeli-inspired, plant-based and kosher menu in and around Washington. Last week the chain was forced to close the last of five locations and lay off the last of 30 staff. It said the war in Gaza had made it impossible to do business; activists claimed the restaurant appropriated Palestinian food and imported Israeli products.\n\n\"It didn't let up: boycotts, harassment, you name it,\" recalled Dennis Friedman, 46, a Jewish American who co-founded Shouk with Ran Nussbacher, who is Israeli. \"The ability to continue to operate wasn't there. I feel terrible because Shouk wasn't a political place; Shouk was a place for people to come together. To become a target and be mislabelled and thrown into things that aren't true is unfortunate.\"\n\nShouk's experience is not unique. Two years of humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza have fractured the consensus that once shielded Israel from significant international pressure. There are growing calls to shun Israeli and Israeli-adjacent businesses, ban the country from sporting and cultural events, and cut ties with its academic institutions. From stadiums to the high street, from concert halls to the political stage, the boycott movement is moving from the fringe to the mainstream.\n\nWhile most of the voices in this article spoke before Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire, activists are vowing to keep up the pressure. The boycott, divestment and sanctions movement criticised the plan to end the war as a \"scheme primarily designed by Israel's fascist government to save it from its unprecedented global isolation\", and called on civil society to step up its efforts.\n\nRevulsion at Israel's wartime conduct has mounted, as images of starving children emerged and the death toll exceeded 67,000 people, according to Gaza's health ministry. Last month a team of independent experts commissioned by the UN's human rights council concluded that Israel was committing genocide.\n\nWhile criticism of Israeli policy is not new, the war in Gaza has acted as a catalyst, shattering taboos, emboldening dissent and pushing public and political sentiment into uncharted territory. Many observers see a turning point on the horizon - one that recalls the global campaign against apartheid in South Africa.\n\nJeremy Ben-Ami, president of J Street, a liberal pro-Israel advocacy group, said: \"It's as big a shift as I've seen in my life regarding attitudes not only in the American Jewish community but the public broadly.\"\n\nBen-Ami added: \"I don't think that this is somehow in any way antisemitic or anti-Israel. It's a rejection of this government and the policies of the Israeli government over not just the last couple of years but going back a few decades at this point.\"\n\nIt is now 20 years since Palestinian civil society organisations called for BDS (boycott, divestment, sanctions) as a form of non-violent pressure on Israel, taking the South African anti-apartheid movement as their inspiration and calling for an end to Israel's occupation and the right of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes. BDS was reviled by conservatives and opposed by the Democratic presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden. Dozens of US states, red and blue, have passed laws over the years to penalize boycotts of Israel.\n\nBut a combination of generational change, revulsion at the events in Gaza and alienation caused by Benjamin Netanyahu's extreme rightwing government is giving BDS new traction, even if many of the actions to target Israel are not formally taking place under the movement's banner.\n\nIn May, 380 writers and organisations including Zadie Smith and Ian McEwan signed a letter stating that the war in Gaza is genocidal and calling for an immediate ceasefire, after an earlier letter from the literary community announcing a boycott of most Israeli cultural institutions. Last month more than 4,500 film workers, many from Hollywood, signed a pledge to boycott \"complicit\" Israeli film institutions and festivals.\n\nEurovision song contest organisers have said member countries will vote in November on whether Israel can participate next year. The event is hugely popular in Israel and its most recent victory - Toy by Netta Barzilai in 2018 - provoked wild celebrations on the streets of Tel Aviv.\n\nDahlia Scheindlin, an Israeli analyst and pollster and visiting scholar at the University of Pennsylvania, said a Eurovision boycott could make particularly big waves: \"It is a cultural phenomenon in Israel. They love it. It's seen as a total source of national pride that Israel participates and does a good job and has occasionally won. I don't have a precedent for how Israel would react if they were kicked out.\"\n\nElsewhere in the music world, hundreds of artists from Björk to Massive Attack have joined a call to block their music from being streamed in Israel.\n\nThen there is football. Fifa and Uefa, the sport's governing bodies, are facing pressure to ban Israel from international competition. The former Manchester United star Eric Cantona has led calls for bodies to suspend Israel and for clubs to refuse to play Israeli teams.\n\nLast month a billboard in New York's Times Square displayed the message \"Israel is committing genocide.\" It was part of a campaign by Game Over Israel, which calls for a boycott of Israel's national team, a boycott of Israeli clubs and a ban on Israeli players.\n\n\"Normalisation in an abnormal time of prolonged genocide is complicity,\" said Ashish Prashar, one of the organisers. \"As long as they step on our football pitches or appear at Eurovision, we are saying we are OK with occupation, we are OK with apartheid and we are OK with genocide.\"\n\nBoycott opponents argue that the efforts are counterproductive and target the innocent, with Israeli film workers and academics in particular arguing that boycotting them silences the country's most critical voices.\n\nBut proponents say the isolation is the point. \"The more isolated Israel gets, the more it realises the world is against its actions, the more its population realises the repercussions of its actions,\" said Prashar, a former adviser to Tony Blair when he was Middle East envoy. \"People will say to me, 'Oh, is that collective punishment?' What do you think Gaza is? Collective punishment is actually what's happening in Gaza. We're holding them accountable for committing these atrocities by isolating them.\"\n\nThe campaign against white minority rule in South Africa offers a historical touchstone and strategic playbook. The country was banned from the Olympics from 1964 onwards; Fifa expelled South Africa in 1976; cricket, rugby and tennis bodies followed, leading to almost total exclusion from big competitions.\n\nThe slogan \"No normal sport in an abnormal society\" became a rallying cry. Writers, musicians and artists were urged not to perform in South Africa or publish their work there. Consumers were urged to shun South African goods such as fruit, cigarettes and alcohol and complicit companies including Shell and Barclays.\n\nJeremy Varon, a history professor who was active in the anti-apartheid divestment movement in the 1980s, recalled that liberation organisations inside South Africa \"explicitly called for a cultural boycott\", which international allies then worked to enforce. The logic was \"to isolate South Africa and South Africans on the world stage\", a key pressure point that played a \"major role in the dooming of apartheid\".\n\nSince the war broke out in Gaza, companies such as McDonald's, Starbucks and Coca-Cola have faced boycotts because of their connections to Israel, while some Israeli-owned companies in the US have been targeted. In a speech last month, Netanyahu acknowledged his country's growing economic isolation, urging Israel to become a \"super Sparta\" of the Middle East.\n\nOmar Barghouti, a founder of the BDS movement and a recipient of the Gandhi peace award, said: \"I wrote back in 2009 that our South Africa moment was nearing. Now I think it's much nearer than ever because the BDS movement is beginning to affect policy. Netanyahu - and we - see the writing on the wall.\"\n\nEven before the war broke out, Barghouti noted, thousands of artists supported a cultural boycott of Israel, but now the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI) has seen a \"drastic qualitative leap\".\n\n\"It's no longer just the progressive artists joining the cultural boycotts; we've always had the Lauryn Hills and the Lordes and the more progressive artists, who are established and not in precarious situations where they would lose their career, though they took very courageous stances.\n\n\"But since the genocide, we've reached the ivory tower of Hollywood, the music industry, the fashion industry, famous chefs, makeup artists, major influencers, writers ... We've never seen such traction before.\"\n\nThe South African comparison is not an entirely neat one, however. First, the anti-apartheid movement had a clear, unified political leadership in Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress (ANC), a structure the Palestinian movement currently lacks. Second, Israel is far more integrated into the global economy and technology sectors, making it significantly harder to isolate than South Africa was. While the cultural boycotts are symbolically significant and some countries have restricted arms sales and trade ties, it is not clear how much Israel's economy has been affected. Haaretz recently reported that Europe's spending on Israeli weapons was at a record high.\n\nThird, Israel has powerful reservoirs of international support - from the US government to Christian Zionists and Jewish Americans - that create a buffer against isolation efforts. Fourth, Netanyahu has sympathy from fellow strongmen around the world, including Donald Trump.\n\nThe difference can be seen in the student movements of both efforts - when the anti-apartheid movement took hold on college campuses in the US, students had some success pressuring university administrations to divest from companies doing business in South Africa. This generation's student movement has similarly demanded its schools divest from Israel - but faces a very different political climate and an aggressive crackdown from Washington.\n\nPeter Beinart, author of Being Jewish After the Destruction of Gaza, said: \"Israel's capacity to maintain its authoritarian system of control of the Palestinians, instead of cutting against the grain of politics in other countries, in some ways is actually at the vanguard of the rise of ethno-nationalist authoritarians around the world.\n\n\"South Africa was not a model for anybody in the late 1980s. But Israel is a model, whether it's for Modi [in India] or Orbán [in Hungary] or the AfD [in Germany] or the Republican party in the United States to some degree. For all of those reasons it's a much more uphill struggle, even though we are seeing shifts in public opinion.\"\n\nBeinart, a professor at the Newmark School of Journalism at the City University of New York, added: \"There's no question that there's been a cultural shift. You can see it dramatically in public opinion. You can see it in popular culture. What's not clear is how that shift in public opinion and popular culture is going to translate into elections and public policy.

We'd have to say Israel, but it was a close-run thing. While the IDF concentrated on the traditional military objective of killing the enemy, the strategy of Hamas focussed on propaganda. The respective results tell their own story.\n\nWhile Hamas has been roundly defeated on the ground, much of the West now agrees with them: jihadism may have its drawbacks, but the real menace is Israel.\n\nIf Western powers are the real losers of this conflict, our social defeat is only beginning. After the Second World War, the political scientist Leo Strauss argued that the victorious United States had absorbed the moral relativism of its enemy.\n\n\"It would not be the first time that a nation, defeated on the battlefield and, as it were, annihilated as a political being, has deprived its conquerors of the most sublime fruit of victory by imposing on them the yoke of its own thought,\" he wrote.\n\nWhat on Earth would Strauss have made of the Israeli triumph, which left the West enthralled by the agenda of jihadism? All over Britain, cosplayers celebrated the second anniversary of October 7, defying pleas from our eunuch Prime Minister to respect the dead of Manchester.\n\nTwo weeks earlier, that same eunuch Prime Minister received congratulations from the jihadis after recognising a Palestinian state without calling upon them to surrender. And they had assumed that their only \"friend\" was Jeremy Corbyn!\n\nThe celebrities who spent two years demanding \"Ceasefire Now\" fell conspicuously silent when Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu secured a ceasefire now. Clearly, they had been hankering only after the kind of ceasefire that followed an Israeli defeat. Or to put it another way, a victory for Hamas.\n\nWas any of this a surprise? The information warfare has been intense. In the heat of battle, the United Nations turned itself into a disinformation machine, endorsing lies of \"genocide\" and \"famine\". Meanwhile, our media erased Hamas, exposing audiences only to pictures of suffering Palestinian civilians. Did nobody wonder how the dead and wounded jihadis had vanished? Any conflict with one side removed makes tragic collateral death feel like \"genocide\".\n\nA study by Andrew Fox showed that 98 per cent of mainstream English-language news reports cited Hamas numbers, of which just two per cent were acknowledged as unreliable. By contrast, Israeli figures were cited in only five per cent of reports, and half of those questioned their credibility. No wonder support for the only democracy in the Middle East was left at rock bottom.\n\nDriven by complacency, naïveté and self-regard, the West has driven itself mad. As the dust settles, international isolation may be Israel's challenge, but that country is resilient. We, on the other hand, have been left with a social rot accelerating our collapse from within.\n\nThe excuse of \"Gaza\" may pass, but after decades of reckless immigration, political sectarianism is here to stay. The hard-Left mobs and Muslim Brotherhood fanatics have won control of our streets, vowing to maintain their aggression regardless of the ceasefire. The Palestine flag now competes with the Union Jack.We don't know who we are any more.\n\nDonald Trump's genius has left Israel in a position of great strength. Its society is resilient, its economy booming, its demographics young and growing, its enemies castrated. In the West, meanwhile, we are in great jeopardy on all those counts. Israel's war may be over, but for us, it is only beginning.\n\n'Never Again?

The US president signed a joint declaration with the leaders of Egypt, Qatar and Turkey intended to turn the ceasefire into a coherent peace plan, amid widespread anxiety over how long the truce will last. Representatives from Israel and Hamas were absent from the signing ceremony.\n\nIn Israel, Trump addressed the Knesset (parliament) earlier on Monday, urging lawmakers to seize a chance for broader peace in the region and saying a \"long nightmare\" for both Israelis and Palestinians was over.\n\nIn Tel Aviv an estimated 65,000 Israelis in \"Hostages Square\" cheered when a military helicopter carrying the 20 freed Israelis flew overhead en route to hospital. Live footage of their release and family reunions was broadcast at the square. The bodies of four hostages held in Gaza and handed over to the Red Cross by Hamas on Monday were brought back to Israel, the army said.\n\nA large crowd also massed in the southern Gazan city of Khan Younis on Monday to celebrate the return of nearly 1,700 Palestinians detained over the course of the war, while in the West Bank capital of Ramallah people welcomed the arrival of 88 Palestinian detainees who had been serving life sentences imposed by Israeli courts.

When the news broke that all the living hostages had been freed from the catacombs, you could almost feel the joy of Israel pushing a new energy into the world.\n\nDeep anxiety remains for the condition of the former captives, some of whom have not yet been reunited with their families. But they are home.\n\nTheir wonderful release was the result of two things: the \"madman\" strategy of Benjamin Netanyahu, which convinced Hamas that no amount of international isolation would cause Israeli troops to give up on their people, and the way the Arab world finally turned against the jihadis.\n\nFor the latter, credit must be placed squarely on the shoulders of Donald Trump. Never has he given any quarter to Hamas. They have always been the enemy of freedom; they started this war; they perpetuated it by refusing to free the hostages; and no amount of propaganda persuaded him otherwise. Surrender or die.\n\nFrom the day Donald Trump replaced the weak and equivocating Joe Biden, all the pressure from the White House descended upon the heads of Hamas and, in recent months, upon the Arab states who had enabled the terror group's survival.\n\nThe operation lacked no subtlety. With a determined combination of American carrots and Israeli sticks, the screws were turned on the Arab world and thence upon the filthy jihadis in their tunnels. The popular narrative that Netanyahu's Doha strike caused Trump to \"rein him in\" misses the point that it struck fear into the Qatari heart, forcing them to pressurise Hamas at last.\n\nAfter two years of constant incitement in Arabic-language media, the Middle East is inflamed with anti-Semitism. But Arab countries are not democracies, and US pressure applied to the leadership classes can make things happen from above.\n\nWhich brings me to the rest of the supposedly free world. Such is our political system that street movements, when they gain enough momentum, can make weak leaders like Starmer and Macron feel like they have their backs against the wall.\n\nI dream of a world in which all the marches we saw in London, Manchester, Edinburgh and elsewhere, which commenced on October 7 before the killing had even abated, were targeting the true culprits: Hamas. In my mind's eye, I see hundreds of thousands of activists thronging the streets of Kensington, flying the Palestinian flag and proudly displaying the yellow ribbon. Out with Hamas! Bring them home! Free, free, Palestine, from the scourge of jihadism!\n\nIt is a sobering truth that we saw far more demonstrations of this sort inside Gaza, where the price is paid in blood, than on the streets of our allegedly free cities.\n\nSuch mass displays of revulsion for Hamas would surely have forced our eunuch Prime Minister to take that message to the United Nations, insisting that he would not recognise a \"State of Palestine\" until Hamas laid down its arms and freed the hostages.\n\nYes, Britain is complicit in this war, and not in the way you think. When those hoards of Israelophobic fanatics dominated our towns and cities, demanding all the concessions that would have ensured victory for Hamas, how did the country respond? With indulgence and excuses. These were not anti-Semites, we said, but \"decent people\" who were simply overwhelmed with disgust at the Jewish appetite for the blood of children.\n\nAfter two years of looking upon these brazen racists with kindliness, Starmer even decided to form his foreign policy on the basis of their warped world-view.\n\nHow must Gazans feel about all this? There are a great many who hate Hamas from the depths of their souls, having lived under its yoke for decades. Since the ceasefire took effect, the jihadis have taken advantage of the window between war and international supervision to launch a campaign of retribution against those clans who criticised the way they brought such devastation into the Strip.\n\nFootage has emerged of torture and summary executions. Hamas has made no attempt to hide these crimes against its own people, just as it has made no attempt to mask its hatred of \"al-Yahud\" and revelled in the butchery of October 7. But the West? As ever, the West has made excuses for Hamas that even Hamas itself has not made.\n\nThe BBC, which consistently mistranslates \"Yahud\" as \"Israelis\" rather than \"Jews\" in an apparent effort to reframe jihadism as fashionable \"anti-Zionism\", described the peace deal as a \"hostage exchange\".\n\nMuch has been written about how Hamas won the propaganda war. In truth, however, it wasn't Hamas that achieved this global success. It was the West that fought it for them. As the continued marches demonstrate, even if the jihadis can be persuaded to lay down their arms, their depraved supporters in our own societies are only just beginning.\n\n'Never Again?

They are in no position to build a Palestinian future\n\nToday, Sharm el-Sheikh will host the most high-profile gathering of global leaders in the Middle East of recent years. Donald Trump, Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron, Pedro Sánchez and others are meeting \"to end the war in the Gaza Strip, enhance efforts to achieve peace and stability in the Middle East, and usher in a new era of regional security and stability\".\n\nIf the ceasefire holds, this language is an augur of the future. One where there is no reckoning, no addressing of root causes. Only a hurtling into the imperatives of cleanings-up and workings-out. All the while illegal occupation continues, and another chapter of Israel's violations is furtively closed without accountability not only for Israel, but for its sponsors.\n\nThere is an Arabic expression, hameeha harameeha - meaning \"its protector is its thief\", that comes to mind as those who have plied Israel with weaponry gather to figure out how to achieve peace in Gaza. Over the coming weeks and months, a Gaza even more devastated than what has been shown to the world so far will come into view. Already the colossal scale of what needs to be rebuilt is becoming clear. People are returning to their homes in Gaza City to find a wasteland flattened to the horizon by bombs and then bulldozers. In the images of the area, even the sunlight looks different and otherworldly. I couldn't figure out why, until I realised it was because there were no structures to filter it. No shade, no shadows. A home returned to is just a plot on which to pitch another tent and wait for aid. But this time, with less risk of being bombed in your sleep.\n\nPeople in Gaza have been released from the fear of death, but what of the life they now face? What of the thousands of orphans, and the wounded or maimed children with no surviving families? It is not just the infrastructure of large parts of Gaza that has been destroyed, it is also the social fabric. Family lineages across two, three, four generations have been wiped out. What of the thousands of parents who have buried their children? And of all those who have collected the body parts of their loved ones? How to even begin to think about addressing such mass trauma when there isn't even a roof to gather under? I asked a man from Gaza about his brother, who had lost all his children and his wife in one strike. Where is he now? \"Just constantly walking around, circling the rubble\" of the site where they died. \"Lost.\"\n\nThe death toll will certainly rise, as bodies that could not previously be retrieved are pulled out of the rubble. At least 10% of Gaza's population has been either killed or injured, and that is a conservative estimate.\n\nIt is important that these facts are not simply totted up and brushed aside as the costs of war. The assault must end, but the terms on which it is ended, and on which the path to peacemaking and reconstruction is based, are crucial. The crimes that have been committed cannot be redressed, or even prevented from recurring, if the conditions that enabled their perpetrators continue.\n\nThis is a difficult thing to insist on when you are dealing with a genocide. The scale of the death and violence, the erasure of the conditions for life, make the cessation of that erasure the most urgent, the only focus. But with that comes exculpation, and worse. Already Donald Trump is taking a victory lap for his peacemaking, after enabling what has taken place for months. Jared Kushner praised Israel's conduct: \"Instead of replicating the barbarism of the enemy, you chose to be exceptional.\" Starmer lauded Trump for securing the deal, and focused on the importance of letting in humanitarian aid. He will, No 10 has said, pay \"particular tribute\" to the US president in Sharm el-Sheikh. And so now we have a crime without criminals, a genocide without génocidaires, a wretched population who, we are to believe, have been brought low by Hamas, and must be fed and watered while the world works out what to do with them. An entire history across Palestine of Israeli impunity and dominion, one of repetitive ethnic cleansing, military rule, expansion of settlements - and now explicit rejection of Palestinian self-determination - is erased, again.\n\nThis time, that exoneration, that framing of what has happened as tragic and finally over, is even more urgent, because the responsibility of countries that have supported Israel and silenced its critics is clearer than ever. Of course you would rush to Sharm el-Sheikh if you were representing a government that provided arms, restricted protest and refused either to endorse declarations of genocide, or to observe the rulings of the ICC when it issued an arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu. Peace in Gaza represents an opportunity to forget; to erase from the collective consciousness an era in which some western countries took a bludgeon to international norms and institutions, and indeed their own domestic politics, in order to force through the destruction of Gaza.\n\nBut many all over the world who have witnessed the massacre, and all that went into sustaining it for two whole years, will not so easily forget. The secure future of those in Gaza, and Palestine in general, is not something that can be delivered by the thieves-turned-protectors. Without the empowerment of the Palestinian people and their self-determination, there can be no faith or trust in Israel or its allies to deliver that constantly invoked \"lasting peace\". The killings have mercifully stopped for now in Gaza, but there must now be a refusal to normalise what will follow - a return to a status quo in which we all keep on pretending that Palestinian life is viable under the authority of Israel.\n\nPalestinians will continue to be killed, their homes stolen, their prisoners tortured and detained without due process. What has been learned in the past two years cannot be unlearned, despite all the energy that will be expended to make that happen. The Palestinian cause cannot be returned to the fringes of \"complex\", marginal politics, a framing that has enabled two years of devastation. That devastation's perpetrators disqualified themselves long ago from any mandate over the people they have aided in killing and shattering. What will now be revealed in the body count and wreckage in Gaza should make that impossible to deny.\n\nAs the world leaders descend, a line from TS Eliot's Gerontion hangs over Sharm el-Sheikh: \"After such knowledge, what forgiveness?\"</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-3.1661710538663663,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"A man from Gaza\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"PLE\",\n    \"quote\": \"Just constantly walking around, circling the rubble...

There is still a great deal of work to do in implementing the longer term steps in the plan laid out by the White House, with perhaps the most urgent obtaining the vital concession that Hamas will agree to lay down arms. After that, attention can begin to shift to the long-term governance of the Strip, the installation of a mooted transitional authority, and the task of ensuring that Hamas and its members never again have any role in ruling over Gaza.\n\nThere is still a long way to go before these objectives are obtained. Yet it is also the case that there is more optimism now that a long-term peace can be reached than there has been for years. And as Sir Keir Starmer has directly stated, this \"would not have happened without President Trump's leadership\".\n\nThat we are now in a world where a long-term deal is obtainable that would see the realisation of almost every demand the supporters of the Palestinian cause have professed to desire is thanks to the willingness of the White House to work with the Israeli state rather than to condemn it from afar, and to the success of the IDF in systematically dismantling Hamas's terror network.\n\nIn other words, it has been attained by pursuing precisely those actions which those claiming to speak on Palestine's behalf have condemned. Sir Keir, Emmanuel Macron, and the other leaders in Europe who lined up to offer Hamas the morale boost of official recognition of an as-yet non-existent Palestinian state should feel shame at their weakness. They should reflect, too, on how little their efforts to appease Hamas achieved.\n\nIsrael's victory in this conflict is a reminder that peace is ultimately achieved through strength, rather than moral posturing from afar. President Trump's success in brokering the first stage of this ceasefire similarly serves as an illustration that negotiation requires you to talk with the other party rather than simply issue denunciations. These are lessons that an increasingly irrelevant continent should take to heart, and soon.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-3.5294100133384148,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Sir Keir Starmer\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"would not have happened without President Trump's leadership\",\n    \"message\": \"The ceasefire agreement would not have been achieved without President Trump's leadership.\"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP"}],"createTime":"2025-10-15T10:37:04.144072Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"UHnvaMjlCNmbm9IPz72j8AY","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":82,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":82}],"promptTokenCount":880,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":880}],"thoughtsTokenCount":799,"totalTokenCount":1761,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}}}

These are the tears I prayed for,\" said one mother of an Israeli hostage detained in Gaza, as reported by Haaretz.\n\nSome of those gathered in the city's hostage square said Trump should be recognised for his role in brokering the deal, calling for a \"Nobel prize to Trump\" as they gathered in the early hours of the morning to celebrate.\n\nEmily Damari, a British-Israeli who was held captive by Hamas for more than a year before being released in January, posted a video to her Instagram celebrating the news with friends who included fellow former hostage Romi Gonen.\n\nThe group could be seen hugging each other and dancing around a room as they toasted \"L'chaim\", meaning \"to life\".\n\nAs part of the agreement, Hamas said it would release the 20 hostages still alive as early as this weekend, with sources saying an exchange with Palestinian prisoners would happen within 72 hours of the deal being signed, which is expected to be Thursday.\n\nDescribing the deal as a \"great day of Israel\", the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said: \"With God's help, we will bring them all home.\"\n\nHamas took 251 people hostage into Gaza in 2023, where 47 remain, including 25 the Israeli military says are dead.\n\n\"The entire nation is waiting and excited,\" said the Israeli defence minister Israel Katz in a post on X. \"I extend a big hug to the families of the hostages for the expected return home of their loved ones, including IDF soldiers and fallen soldiers.\"\n\nNetanyahu said he would convene the government on Thursday to approve the Gaza ceasefire agreement, while Hamas called on Trump and guarantor states to ensure Israel fully implements it.\n\nSparked by the 7 October attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 people, many of them civilians, Israel's retaliatory military campaign has been devastating, killing more than 67,000 people, including many children, as aid blockades have resulted in starvation and acute hunger.\n\nThe war has razed Palestinian territory and unleashed a major humanitarian crisis.\n\nEyad Amawi, a Palestinian aid coordinator displaced in central Gaza, said he was still comprehending news of the ceasefire agreement.\n\n\"We believe and don't believe. We have mixed feelings, between happiness and sadness, memories, everything is mixed,\" he said.\n\nAmawi said he hoped the deal was implemented as agreed so that people could return to their homes and begin to \"renew the [will] and the hope for life\" in Gaza where many children are injured and rubble is everywhere.\n\nHis biggest fear, he said, was Israel creating obstacles to implementing the agreement.\n\n\"We need to fix everything here, especially the psychological effects to [continue] with our lives.\"\n\nEven as initial celebrations unfolded, details of the agreement remained unclear on Thursday, including whether the parties in Egypt had made any progress on thornier questions about the future of the conflict, such as whether Hamas will demilitarise, as Trump has demanded, and how the war-torn territory will be governed in future.\n\nIf it is implemented, the deal would bring the two sides closer than any previous effort to halting a war that has evolved into a regional conflict, drawing in countries such as Iran, Yemen and Lebanon, and reshaping the Middle East.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.6737492040836768,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Ahmed Sheheiber\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"PLE\",\n    \"quote\": \"It's a huge day, huge joy.\",\n    \"message\": \"The current day is a momentous occasion filled with great happiness.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Ayman Saber\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"Resident\",\n    \"nationality\": \"PLE\",\n    \"quote\": \"I can't believe the news.\",\n    \"message\": \"The news of the peace deal is astonishing and difficult to comprehend.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Mother of an Israeli hostage\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"Mother of an Israeli hostage\",\n    \"nationality\": \"ISR\",\n    \"quote\": \"Matan is coming home.

As well as her tuition fees, her scholarship from a charity, the Council for At Risk Academics (Cara), covers housing and living costs for her and all family members.\n\nShe completed visa applications for the family, but last month, just before her studies were due to start, she received an email from the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), saying that her family would not be allowed to travel with her.\n\nAs part of a UK crackdown on immigration, most international students are not allowed to bring their dependents with them. However, there are exceptions for full-time PhD students such as Houbi, whose scholarship and visa permit her to bring her family.\n\nWhen questioned about Houbi's case during a recent BBC interview, David Lammy, the deputy prime minister, said: \"It's important to understand that we are actually dependent on Israeli permissions to bring those people out, and that has not been easy to get.\"\n\nBut Israeli officials said they had not blocked Houbi leaving Gaza.\n\n\"It should be clarified that Israel does not impose any limit on the number of residents exiting Gaza and relies solely on the requests submitted by the receiving countries,\" said a spokesperson for Cogat, the Israeli government department responsible for approving evacuations.\n\nThe news has left Houbi devastated. \"The fact that the UK government hasn't even bothered to make a request on my family's behalf is heartbreaking,\" she said.\n\nHoubi and her family are now living in a tent in Khan Younis, after their home in Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, was destroyed by Israeli airstrikes early in the war.\n\nHoubi's PhD research will explore how media and education can combat violence against women and promote peace. She said she hopes to return to Gaza after completing her PhD to teach, empower women and develop programmes that drive awareness and transformation.\n\n\"She is such an excellent candidate for a scholarship that she was able to pick the scheme that allows her to bring dependents,\" said Prof Alison Phipps, academic supervisor at the University of Glasgow. \"No parent should be forced to choose their studies over their family, not least when this is a firm criterion of the scholarship itself.\"\n\nLast month, the first group of university students from Gaza arrived in the UK after months of campaigning by politicians, academics and activists on behalf of Palestinian students holding offers from UK universities.\n\nMatt Foster, chief executive at Cara, which awarded Houbi her scholarship, said the charity \"is ready and waiting to support this family and we call on the UK government to support their evacuation immediately\".\n\nScottish education secretary Jenny Gilruth said she had requested an urgent meeting with the foreign secretary.\n\nAn FCDO spokesperson said: \"The government is working with universities to identify eligible students and to assist them to leave Gaza and take up their studies in the UK. This has been a highly complex process, but we have already successfully evacuated a number of students and expect further cohorts to arrive in the coming weeks.\"</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.417661292530666,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Manar al-Houbi\",\n    \"organisation\": \"University of Glasgow\",\n    \"role\": \"PhD Student\",\n    \"nationality\": \"PLE\",\n    \"quote\": \"It felt almost too good to be true.\",\n    \"message\": \"The successful application for a fully funded scholarship felt almost unbelievable due to its generous benefits.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"David Lammy\",\n    \"organisation\": \"UK Government\",\n    \"role\": \"Deputy Prime Minister\",\n    \"nationality\": \"GBR\",\n    \"quote\": \"It's important to understand that we are actually dependent on Israeli permissions to bring those people out, and that has not been easy to get.\",\n    \"message\": \"The UK government's efforts to facilitate the departure of individuals from Gaza are reliant on securing permissions from Israeli authorities, which has proven difficult to obtain.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Spokesperson for Cogat\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Cogat\",\n    \"role\": \"Spokesperson\",\n    \"nationality\": \"ISR\",\n    \"quote\": \"It should be clarified that Israel does not impose any limit on the number of residents exiting Gaza and relies solely on the requests submitted by the receiving countries.\",\n    \"message\": \"Israel clarifies that it places no restrictions on the number of residents departing Gaza and only acts upon requests submitted by the countries intending to receive them.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Manar al-Houbi\",\n    \"organisation\": \"University of Glasgow\",\n    \"role\": \"PhD Student\",\n    \"nationality\": \"PLE\",\n    \"quote\": \"The fact that the UK government hasn't even bothered to make a request on my family's behalf is heartbreaking.\",\n    \"message\": \"The UK government's failure to submit a request on behalf of her family for their entry into the UK is deeply distressing.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Prof Alison Phipps\",\n    \"organisation\": \"University of Glasgow\",\n    \"role\": \"Academic supervisor\",\n    \"nationality\": \"GBR\",\n    \"quote\": \"She is such an excellent candidate for a scholarship that she was able to pick the scheme that allows her to bring dependents.

The three issues constitute the first phase of a 20-point plan presented by the US president, Donald Trump, last week that aims to end the war.\n\nThough key points of the plan still need negotiation, Hamas's acceptance of a hostage release and to relinquish power in the Gaza Strip has galvanised renewed momentum behind peace talks.\n\nTrump on Sunday described the talks as \"very successful and proceeding rapidly\" and that he expected that the first phase would be completed this week, in a post on social media. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that he expected the talks to last just a few days and that he hoped he could announce the release of all Israeli hostages in the coming days.\n\nDespite the optimism, large gaps remain between Hamas and Israel. The Trump plan is large in scope but scant on details, and key points of the plan still need to be discussed.\n\nThe talks on Monday began with a meeting between Arab mediators and the Palestinian delegation after which mediators would then meet with the Israeli delegation. Egyptian and Qatari mediators would then discuss both sets of talks before meeting the US envoy Steve Witkoff, according to Egyptian media.\n\nThe first topic of discussion is the mechanism of a hostage release, which under the terms of the Trump plan, should happen within 72 hours of a ceasefire. Hamas officials have already warned they will probably need more time to locate the remains of hostages that are buried under rubble.\n\nThe logistics of how to coordinate a hostage releasehave yet to be decided, though the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on Monday offered to help transfer prisoners and hostages as an impartial humanitarian actor. It previously facilitated hostage releases during a ceasefire in January.\n\nNegotiators have to agree which Palestinian prisoners will be released from Israeli jails. The Palestinian delegation is likely to ask for political figures, such as the Palestinian leader Marwan Barghouthi, who are widely popular in the West Bank and Gaza. Rightwing members of Netanyahu's coalition have put pressure on to ensure such popular figures remain behind bars, Israeli media has reported.\n\nItamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right public security minister, threatened to quit the government if Hamas still existed after the release of hostages, adding another complication to already fragile peace talks.\n\nThe US has asked Israel to stop bombing Gaza, with the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, saying on Sunday that a cessation in bombing was necessary to facilitate the release of hostages.\n\nDespite this, Israel has continued to strike and fire on Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, killing at least 19 people, including two aid seekers, in the last 24 hours, according to the Gaza ministry of health. Israel on Saturday said it was only carrying out defensive strikes in Gaza.\n\nThe talks have been hailed by Palestinian, Israeli, western and Arab officials, who have urged both sides to reach a lasting truce on the eve of the war's second anniversary.\n\nEgypt's president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, welcomed the Trump plan on Monday, which he said could lead to \"lasting peace.\" \"A ceasefire, the return of hostages and detainees, the reconstruction of Gaza, and the start of a peaceful political process leading to the establishment and recognition of a Palestinian state mean that we are on the right path toward lasting peace and solid stability,\" Sisi said in an address commemorating the anniversary of the 6 October 1973 war with Israel.\n\nIf implemented, Trump's plan would result in an immediate end to fighting in Gaza, the release of all 48 hostages held by Hamas - 20 of whom are believed to still be alive - the disarmament of the militant group and the handing over of power from Hamas to an international transitional governing body headed by Trump. Israel in return would gradually withdraw to a buffer zone at the edges of the strip, and return nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.\n\nThe plan would also send a surge of humanitarian aid to Gaza - parts of which are experiencing famine due to an Israeli aid blockade - and reconstruction funds for the demolished strip.\n\nIf talks manage to succeed in reaching a consensus on the first phase of the Trump plan, they will then have to grapple with more existential issues concerning the long-term future of Gaza, including Hamas's arms, long-term withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, the makeup of the transitional governing body and a pathway to a Palestinian state.\n\nThe EU would like to play a role in the transitional governing body in Gaza, theEU's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, told reporters on Monday. \"Yes we feel that Europe has a great role and we should also be onboard with this,\" Kallas said, after being asked if the EU desired to be on what Trump called his \"board of peace\".\n\nPressure for an end to the war grew in Israel over the weekend as frustration with the government's handling of ceasefire efforts intensified. Families of Israeli hostages held in Gaza sent a letter to the Nobel prize committee asking it to award the peace prize to Trump for his efforts to end the war. Trump has longed for a Nobel peace prize, a fact he has not been shy about.\n\n\"We strongly urge you to award President Trump the Nobel peace prize because he has vowed he will not rest and will not stop until every last hostage is back home,\" the families said in their letter.\n\nIn Gaza, exhausted residents prayed for an end to the war. Israel's campaign in Gaza has killed at least 67,160 Palestinians and wounded about 170,000. Israel launched the war after Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostages on 7 October 2023.\n\nIsrael stands accused of committing genocide in Gaza by a UN commission of inquiry, the world's leading association of genocide scholars and several human rights organisations.

Helicopters were prepared to airlift them to one of three Israeli hospitals - Sheba, Ichilov and Rabin - for further treatment if necessary.\n\nSome earlier freed hostage have appeared gaunt and weak, and doctors have warned of their complex psychological and medical needs. Groups representing hostages and their families have stressed that both - including the families of the deceased - will need ongoing medical, psychological and social rehabilitation.\n\nProf Hagai Levine, who is head of the health team for the hostages' families, said on Monday that he had repeatedly warned of the \"grave danger\" for the health of the hostages and their families.\n\n\"We now hope that, with the return of all of the hostages, we can begin a process of full rehabilitation - for the survivors of captivity, for the families, and for society as a whole. Medical, psychological, and social rehabilitation is a long and complex process that requires responsibility, coordination and cooperation,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe Rabin medical centre in Petah Tikva, a city north-east of Tel Aviv, has established a Returning Hostages Unit after treating former captives released in exchanges in January and February, including Omer Shem Tov and Eliya Cohen, who were abducted from the Nova music festival. The department did not exist prior to Hamas's 7 October attack.\n\nThe hospital, Israel's second largest, has said every hostage receives care from a wide range of specialists including physiotherapists, speech and occupational therapists, psychologists and nutritionists. It added that the families of the hostages are offered rooms in the unit.\n\nThe Israeli government has also prepared welcome kits for each returnee with handwritten messages from the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his wife, Sara. The kits include clothing, personal equipment, a laptop and a mobile phone.\n\nExperts at hospitals that have treated hostages stress that rehabilitation is a long process and that complications may arise months or even years later. Rabin said it had established Israel's only long-term Hostages Rehabilitation Unit and that medical teams have continued to support the hostages and their families even after discharge.\n\nThe British-Israeli hostage Emily Damari, who was freed in January, told the New York Times that she faced months of rehabilitation in hospital and at a halfway hotel, and surgery for the wounds she sustained when she was abducted. Romi Gonen, who was taken from the Nova music festival, has also had surgery since her release.\n\nA spokesperson at Sheba, which is reportedly preparing to receive 10 hostages, said the rehabilitation process was long. \"Once the hostages are returned, they are reunited with their families first, and then they will go through a series of medical examinations and it could take a long time because they've been in captivity for two years.\n\n\"We're going to take our time. They can stay at Sheba for as long as they need, for any of the medical or psychological care that they will need going forward.\n\n\"We're not going to push them at all. We never do that. The most important thing is to reintegrate them with their families, society, and whatever they need we will give them, all of the amenities of home - good food, relaxation - and that's all in between the medical examinations that they will have.\"\n\nAfter they are discharged from hospital, the hostages, some of whom lost their homes in the 7 October attacks, can begin to rebuild their lives.\n\n\"The process does not end with release - it begins with it,\" the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement on Monday. \"After two years under inhumane conditions of starvation, deprivation of medical care, isolation, violation and abuse, they now need medical care, close supervision, and peace - and above all, the restoration of their identity as people, not as 'hostages'.\n\n\"Their bodies and minds have endured prolonged injury, and their treatment must take place in a safe, calm, and respectful environment.\"</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.8457536052044173,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Hagai Levine\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"head of the health team for the hostages' families\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"We now hope that, with the return of all of the hostages, we can begin a process of full rehabilitation - for the survivors of captivity, for the families, and for society as a whole.

The unimaginable horrors experienced by many of the Israeli hostages during the past two years were graphically laid bare in The Telegraph's weekend interview with former Israeli hostage Eli Sharabi, who lost his wife and two daughters during the Hamas terrorists' initial onslaught. At one point, Sharabi became so emaciated he begged his captors to break his ribs in return for providing food.\n\nUnsurprisingly, many Israelis want the return of the 48 hostages still being held by Hamas to be their government's number one priority, irrespective of whether they are alive or dead. This is why the hostage issue has now taken centre stage after US President Donald Trump outlined his 20-point plan for ending the Gaza conflict that erupted in the wake of Hamas's heinous attack.\n\nTrump's latest attempt to end the Gaza conflict contains a range of requirements, not least of which, so far as Hamas is concerned, is that the terrorist organisation surrender its weapons, withdraw its fighters from Gaza and accept that it has no future role to play in any future discussions on the Palestine issue.\n\nYet, rather than addressing all the key points set out in Trump's peace plan, Hamas has instead opted to focus primarily on the hostage issue, calculating that it is the option most likely to force Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu into accepting a ceasefire in Gaza. And, to judge by Netanyahu's response, Hamas's attempts to employ its own form of emotional blackmail to implement a ceasefire has had the desired effect. In a televised address to Israelis, Netanyahu declared that he hoped to announce the release of the remaining hostages in the \"coming days.\"\n\nWhether or not this happens depends to a large extent on the outcome of talks scheduled to take place later today in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, where representatives of both Hamas and Israel will be in the same building without having direct contact.\n\nIn return for Hamas releasing the remaining Israeli hostages, Israel is expected to release 250 Palestinian prisoners who are serving life sentences for committing acts of terrorism, as well as around 1,700 Palestinian detainees held since the October 7 attacks.\n\nWe have, of course, been here before. Back in January, Trump demanded that, in return for Israel agreeing to a temporary ceasefire in Gaza, Hamas must release its remaining hostages before he began his second term in the White House. This resulted in the grotesque spectacle of Hamas parading emaciated Israeli hostages - including Sharabi - before baying mobs of Hamas supporters prior to being handed over to the Red Cross.\n\nHamas's inhumane exploitation of the hostages as a publicity stunt was one of the reasons that Netanyahu finally lost patience with its antics, and resumed Israel's military campaign to eliminate the terror group. And even though Hamas officials say they are \"very keen\" to begin what they call \"the prisoner exchange process,\" the Netanyahu government will remain deeply sceptical that they have any genuine intention of accepting all of the Trump administration's stipulations for ending the Gaza conflict.\n\nHamas's official reaction to Trump's initiative certainly fell well short of giving a comprehensive response, with the group failing to address the disarmament issue or to acknowledge that it has no future role to play in the Palestine issue. Instead it called for further negotiations on how Gaza should be administered once hostilities have ended.\n\nThe only conclusion to be drawn from this less-than-satisfactory statement is that the Hamas leadership has no intention of surrendering its stranglehold over Gaza. Instead, it is hoping that, by indulging in the politics of procrastination, it can focus attention purely on the hostage issue and distract attention away from less palatable concerns, such as its future prospects.\n\nHamas will be well aware that, if fully implemented, Trump's peace plan is effectively a death sentence for its continued involvement in Palestinian affairs. It is for this reason that, no matter how strong the desire may be in Washington and Jerusalem to secure the release of all the remaining Israeli hostages, Trump and his allies must understand that Hamas's main objective is not aimed at ending hostilities in Gaza, but at ensuring its own survival.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-3.9893655215992645,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Benjamin Netanyahu\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Government of Israel\",\n    \"role\": \"Prime Minister\",\n    \"nationality\": \"ISR\",\n    \"quote\": \"coming days.\",\n    \"message\": \"We hope to announce the release of the remaining hostages in the coming days.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Hamas officials\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Hamas\",\n    \"role\": \"officials\",\n    \"nationality\": \"PLE\",\n    \"quote\": \"very keen\",\n    \"message\": \"We are very keen to begin the prisoner exchange process.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Hamas officials\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Hamas\",\n    \"role\": \"officials\",\n    \"nationality\": \"PLE\",\n    \"quote\": \"the prisoner exchange process\",\n    \"message\": \"We refer to the negotiation for releasing captives as the prisoner exchange process.\"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP"}],"createTime":"2025-10-15T10:37:06.823289Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"UnnvaPmfMr2qmecP1b-B-Ac","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":221,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":221}],"promptTokenCount":1360,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1360}],"thoughtsTokenCount":3835,"totalTokenCount":5416,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}}}

That's a massive challenge,\" said ICRC's spokesperson Christian Cardon. \"I think that there is clearly a risk that that will take much more time. What are we telling the parties is that that should be their top priority,\" he said.\n\nCardon said it could take days or weeks and that there was a possibility the remains would never be found. Hamas had already notified mediators that they do not know what happened to two of the 28 that remain missing.\n\nHamas has so far handed over four caskets which were taken to the Abu Kabir forensic institute in Tel Aviv for identification.\n\nHamas has in the past sent back unrelated bodies instead of hostages.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Israeli military said it had formally identified two of those handed over as Guy Illouz, 26, and Bipin Joshi, 23.\n\nIllouz, who was building a career in the music industry, was shot at Nova music festival on 7 October 2023 and was taken to a hospital in Gaza where he died of his wounds.\n\nJoshi, a Nepalese agriculture student who was in Israel to study, was kidnapped from Alumim kibbutz, where he was studying local farming methods.\n\nVideo footage released by the Israeli military soon after the 2023 Hamas attacks appeared to show Joshi being dragged into Gaza's Shifa hospital, his last known sighting alive.\n\nThe two other bodies in the possession of the Israeli authorities and undergoing identification are said by Hamas to be those of Yossi Sharabi and Daniel Perez.\n\nSharabi, 53, from Be'eri kibbutz, was kidnapped on 7 October 2023 from his home, where he and his family were hiding inside a reinforced room.\n\nGunmen killed the family dog and brought all those in the security room outside on to the lawn at gunpoint.\n\nYossi was last seen being taken to Gaza in a black vehicle along with Ofir Engel, his daughter's boyfriend, who had been visiting the family for the weekend, and a neighbour, Amit Shani. Engel and Shani were released in previous exchanges. The cause of Yossi's death is unknown.\n\nThe final body is said to be Perez, a platoon commander in the 7th Armored Brigade's 77th battalion who was killed near the Gaza border on 7 October 2023.\n\nPerez was born and raised in Johannesburg, South Africa, where he attended religious schools before moving to Israel with his family in 2014.\n\nOn Tuesday, Israel's military said that it had opened fire that morning to remove a threat posed by people who approached its forces in northern Gaza. It was reported that at least six Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire in two separate incidents.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.9180048916635196,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Yael Adar\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"The struggle is not over until the last captive returns\",\n    \"message\": \"The effort to bring back all captives will continue until every single one is returned.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Israeli Hostages and Missing Families Forum\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Israeli Hostages and Missing Families Forum\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"ISR\",\n    \"quote\": \"must be met with a serious response\",\n    \"message\": \"Hamas's failure to release all of the bodies of deceased hostages necessitates a strong reaction.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Christian Cardon\",\n    \"organisation\": \"International Committee of the Red Cross\",\n    \"role\": \"Spokesperson\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"That's an even bigger challenge than having the people alive being released.

Minutes later, the US president went on Truth Social, his social media platform, to thank both men by name.\n\nWhile Trump has played down his chances to win the prize, he has been active behind the scenes, phoning Jens Stoltenberg, Norway's finance minister, in Oslo this summer to tell him he wanted to discuss the \"Nobel peace prize ... and tariffs\". He regularly brings up the award; usually as he makes the tenuous claim to have ended six or seven wars since his return to the White House.\n\n\"If I were named Obama, I would have had the Nobel prize given to me in 10 seconds,\" Trump said last year during the presidential race.\n\nThe obsession has become a running joke among foreign diplomats seeking to lobby their interests, including at a regular breakfast among European ambassadors where a common topic is how to keep Trump engaged in the support of Ukraine.\n\n\"Anytime he is talking about solving seven wars, he is really sending a message: give me the Nobel,\" said one senior European diplomat based in Washington.\n\nThe Nobel peace prize was believed to be a key motivator in his recent efforts to broker a ceasefire in Ukraine, influencing a rare summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska that was seen as a major gamble if it was interpreted as appeasing the Kremlin.\n\nUltimately, Putin was unmoved and Trump appeared to lose interest in ending Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\n\"Once he figured out that was too hard, we're back to Gaza,\" the diplomat said.\n\nTrump's new push for a peace deal to end the war kicked into gear during last month's UN general assembly, where he met with Arab leaders and then approved a 20-point peace plan that he announced during a White House summit with Benjamin Netanyahu in late September.\n\nThe timeline for the award has played an active role in trying to reach a deal this week, as officials have regularly said they believed a peace deal would be ready by Friday - the same day as the Nobel committee announces its choice.\n\nDoron Hadar, a former negotiator, told the Washington Post on Thursday that the \"Friday morning deadline is shaping the timeline, the announcement of the Nobel Committee in Oslo.\n\n\"Everyone understands this timeline, and that's why I believe that by [Thursday] evening, there will already be a declaration that the sides have reached agreements,\" he said, according to the outlet.\n\nIn a delicious bit of irony, the Norwegian committee told Agence-France Presse that it had held its final meeting on Monday - two days before Trump announced the first phase of the peace deal on Truth Social.\n\nBut amid the naked ambition behind Trump's push for peace in Gaza, even those who have been highly critical of the war have hailed the deal as a major achievement.\n\n\"This is definitely a morning for celebration,\" wrote Gershon Baskin, an Israeli peace activist and hostage negotiator. \"The war is ending. The killing and destruction will stop.\"\n\nLater, he added: \"In conclusion of these first thoughts: President Trump deserves the Nobel Peace Prize.\"</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.5082377376242573,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Brian Mast\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Republican Party\",\n    \"role\": \"Congressman\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"Everybody has been talking about: 'Will he get the Nobel Peace Prize?'

He is seeking to bolster US support for Aukus and ensure the US continues to provide military protection for Australia in the Asia-Pacific region. Of course, there will be talk of tariffs, too.\n\nIt's traditional diplomacy - with a catch. Albanese needs support from the very superpower that is undermining the global principles and institutions Australia has long held dear, notably human rights, democracy and the international rule of law. These are principles and institutions that previous US administrations claimed to care about too.\n\nWhat makes the meeting even more complex is that, during his second term, Trump has made it difficult for countries - even longtime allies - to know if they are friend or foe, undermining traditional alliances.\n\nTrump has set up a game of geopolitical musical chairs. As the music plays, countries desperate not to be left out of trade, economic alliances or deals with the US run around the chairs with urgent self-interest. They seem to believe that when the music stops it's not values or principles that will get them a seat but sycophancy and cunning.\n\nAustralia hears the music too and understands the game and does not want to incur Trump's wrath. But what is Albanese to do? Avoid taking human rights positions that could lead to higher tariffs? The government should recognise that politics of appeasement don't work. Concessions to bullies only embolden them to demand more. In the long run, if Trump continues to hack away at rules and norms, it will impose high costs for everyone.\n\nThe global human rights movement is already feeling the impact of Trump's foreign policy. Within days of taking office, Trump withdrew from the World Health Organization and disengaged from UN human rights council, platforms for collective action against epidemics, atrocities, climate change and more. The Trump administration has sanctioned the international criminal court and threatens to undermine decades of investment, including by Australia, to bring justice to victims of the worst crimes globally. He has halted virtually all US payments to the UN, plunging the organisation into financial crisis. As the largest donor to human rights and humanitarian causes, the US terminated much of that funding.\n\nIt is in Australia's best interests to step forward to defend and enhance human rights. They are more than an issue to rank alongside other priorities and are a critical piece of everything Australia seeks - from prosperous economic alliances to transparency and fair-trade practices across the region.\n\nGovernments that deny human rights create chaos and fear. Repressive regimes will go to great lengths to control their populations and deny them freedoms, sometimes even driving a repressed population to rise up to insist on better lives. In this region alone, look at recent events in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Indonesia and now Nepal - all with popular movements for their rights and against authoritarianism.\n\nGovernments that ignore human rights are also dubious partners, bringing with them risks in trade, diplomacy and security alliances with their lack of transparency or governance through decree.\n\nIn this new world order, where the rules are not only being broken but intentionally dismantled, Australia's role is that much more consequential.\n\nAt the United Nations general assembly in September, Albanese said, \"If we resign ourselves to the idea that war is inevitable, or relegate ourselves to the status of disinterested bystanders, if our only response to every crisis is to insist that there is nothing we can do, then we risk being trusted with nothing.\"\n\nAs a leader among middle-power nations, Albanese could still do more to resist the Trump government's policies that undermine the global rule of law. The Australian government should centre human rights in all dealings with foreign governments - including the Trump administration. And it should take the initiative.\n\nWhen Albanese sits with Trump, he should raise concerns about US sanctions on the international criminal court and make clear his government will back the court's work across the board. He should encourage Trump to reconsider the aid cuts given that the long-term consequences will be harmful for both the US and Australia, whether with respect to irregular migrants or China.\n\nAnd while he will doubtlessly congratulate Trump for his role in negotiating a ceasefire between Israeli authorities and Hamas, he should still talk about crimes in Ukraine, Gaza and Sudan and the need for accountability.\n\nRaising these issues may not endear Albanese to Trump, but neither will shying away from being an assertive leader. Albanese needs to lead the way demonstrating that he can cement Aukus, handle the tariff issue and defend human rights. Each of these are in the Australian national interest.\n\nAlbanese should not relegate Australia to the status of \"disinterested bystander\", just as his UN speech warns against. Unnecessary concessions to Trump's worldview merely encourages what Albanese himself foreshadowed, \"being trusted with nothing\". Should that happen, human rights will surely suffer.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-3.13099419580747,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Anthony Albanese\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Australian Government\",\n    \"role\": \"Prime Minister\",\n    \"nationality\": \"AUS\",\n    \"quote\": \"If we resign ourselves to the idea that war is inevitable, or relegate ourselves to the status of disinterested bystanders, if our only response to every crisis is to insist that there is nothing we can do, then we risk being trusted with nothing.\",\n    \"message\": \"If one accepts the inevitability of war, or chooses to be a disinterested bystander, and responds to every crisis by asserting helplessness, then one risks losing all trust.\"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP"}],"createTime":"2025-10-15T10:37:04.145577Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"UHnvaKnxCOiAm9IP78e4iQY","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":146,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":146}],"promptTokenCount":1421,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1421}],"thoughtsTokenCount":2411,"totalTokenCount":3978,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}}}

Yet the story dominating domestic headlines as MPs returned from recess this week is not fiction, or at least not entirely.\n\nWhy was the prosecution of Christopher Cash, a researcher for parliament's China Research Group, and his teacher friend, Christopher Berry, dropped so close to going to trial? The speaker of the Commons, Lindsay Hoyle, took the unusual step on Monday of expressing both his anger at the decision, and his fear that parliament was not being properly protected from foreign interference. For days the current government and the last one have been blaming each other for failing to designate China a threat to national security, without which step, the director of public prosecutions has said, the trial could not go ahead, and it's likely the Official Secrets Act will now be overhauled. But underneath it lies the much more awkward question of how far small countries desperate for inward investment dare risk offending a rich superpower, even when it is sometimes working actively to subvert them.\n\nWhen the likes of former national security adviser Mark Sedwill or former head of Secret Intelligence Service John Sawers line up alongside MPs to express bafflement that the evidence against Cash and Berry wasn't tested in court, what you're hearing is snatches of a decade-long argument conducted mostly behind the scenes about the risks of becoming beholden to an autocracy that represents both threat and opportunity.\n\nBut high geopolitical concerns aren't the only reason Westminster is obsessed with this case. Politically speaking, it's turning out to be a tremendous stick with which to beat Powell, who after Morgan McSweeney - himself now badly weakened by recent dramas - is the man on whom Keir Starmer probably relies more than any other in Downing Street to stop the wheels falling off.\n\nThe one acknowledged bright spot of Starmer's year in office has been his command of foreign policy, which owes a fair bit to Powell's decades of experience first as a diplomat and then as a chief of staff to Tony Blair. Now that Peter Mandelson, another survivor of that era, has once again been sacked in disgrace, it's Powell who most obviously embodies the lingering influence of the old Blairites over a Starmer government some suspect of trying to remake in their image. (The praise heaped on Powell this weekend by Donald Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, who credited his \"incredible input and tireless efforts\" to secure a Middle East peace deal, unfortunately doesn't help the impression of the old team quietly calling the shots, given the suggestions that Blair could play a prominent role in overseeing the rebuilding of Gaza.) This weekend's spate of anonymous ministerial briefings against Powell - accusing him of being too soft on China - suggests some now feel emboldened to attack.\n\nThe official and categoric Downing Street line is that the government didn't intervene to get the Crown Prosecution Service to drop the case, and that while Powell discussed the spying allegations at a Whitehall meeting last month, he played no part in the \"substance or the evidence\" of the case. His critics will retort that that wasn't really the charge, but since nobody can seemingly specify exactly what the charge is - beyond Powell having a level of influence within No 10 that might or might not be a bad idea depending on your political stance - it is difficult to rebut. Enter a Tory opposition that despite giving every appearance of being dead and buried can still run a surprisingly effective attack operation, as it did last month over Angela Rayner's stamp duty woes, and is now crying cover-up - a charge more incendiary than it used to be, in an age when conspiratorial thinking is rife. Knowing where the bodies are buried over China policy is easier when you have some experience with a spade, as previous Tory administrations certainly do.\n\nIt was George Osborne as chancellor who first steamrollered over opposition within his own cabinet to announce a new \"golden era\" of deals with China. Theresa May's cabinet privately agonised over whether to let the Chinese company Huawei supply key parts of Britain's 5G mobile phone network, losing a defence secretary in the process (Gavin Williamson was sacked for allegedly briefing a journalist about the discussions). Rishi Sunak, who had to deal with the fallout from Chinese hackers targeting the Electoral Commission, plus anxieties about the influence of Chinese-owned TikTok, went so far as to call China the \"greatest state-based threat to our economic security\", but refused pleas from senior Tories to formally designate it an enemy.\n\nNow it's Keir Starmer's turn to muddle through an excruciating dilemma that none of his predecessors solved, in an era where it's even harder for beggars to be choosers: one where money is tighter, economic growth is more crucial to helping Labour see off the threat from Reform, America is no longer a reliable ally and Beijing is watching beadily to see how much Russia gets away with in Ukraine, while Chinese and Russian hackers pose an increasingly existential threat to British businesses. An era, in other words, where a novice prime minister could easily go under without wise counsel. The next few days should determine whether Starmer can hang on to his.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-3.586440655363708,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Steve Witkoff\",\n    \"organisation\": \"United States Government\",\n    \"role\": \"Special Envoy\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"incredible input and tireless efforts\",\n    \"message\": \"Jonathan Powell provided incredible input and tireless efforts to secure a Middle East peace deal.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Downing Street\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Downing Street\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"GBR\",\n    \"quote\": \"substance or the evidence\",\n    \"message\": \"Jonathan Powell played no part in the substance or the evidence of the spying allegations case.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Rishi Sunak\",\n    \"organisation\": \"United Kingdom Government\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"GBR\",\n    \"quote\": \"greatest state-based threat to our economic security\",\n    \"message\": \"China is the greatest state-based threat to the United Kingdom's economic security.\"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP"}],"createTime":"2025-10-15T10:37:04.153093Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"UHnvaIWsCeiAm9IP78e4iQY","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":238,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":238}],"promptTokenCount":1528,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1528}],"thoughtsTokenCount":2883,"totalTokenCount":4649,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}}}

Trump also said he would consider similar action against Los Angeles for the 2028 Olympics on account of potential safety issues.\n\nTrump has no legal authority to directly take either action, but he can apply pressure to each competition's governing body to move host cities.\n\nHis comments came at a press event with Argentinian president Javier Milei, who was visiting the White House after the announcement of a $20bn bailout for the South American country. Towards the end of the event, a reporter asked Trump about a recent \"street takeover\" in Boston that saw police officers attacked and a police car set aflame, and if the concerns raised by the incident could result in the revocation of hosting duties for next year's expanded 48-team soccer tournament. The reporter also asked if Trump would work with Michelle Wu, the mayor of Boston, to address the issue.\n\n\"We could take them away,\" Trump said of the World Cup games, which are due to be held at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, about 22 miles southwest of Boston. \"Their mayor is not good ... she's radical left, and they're taking over parts of Boston. That's a pretty big statement, right?\"\n\nStreet takeovers, a social media-driven phenomenon that sees large crowds of people gather on city streets late at night to perform stunts in cars, have been a repeated nuisance in American cities since the Covid-19 pandemic shutdowns. Recent such gatherings have turned violent in Massachusetts, including in Boston. However, the gatherings are generally not seen as being tied to any particular political ideology.\n\n\"If someone is doing a bad job, and I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni [Infantino], the head of Fifa, who is phenomenal, and say let's move it to another location,\" Trump said on Tuesday. \"And he would do that. He wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it. Very easily, he'd do it.\"\n\nInfantino has made no secret of his efforts to be publicly aligned with Trump ahead of next year's tournament, due to be hosted in 11 cities across the US along with two in Canada and three in Mexico. The Fifa president has appeared at several Oval Office events, had Trump deliver the Club World Cup trophy to Chelsea after that tournament's final (where the US president overstayed his welcome during the trophy lift), and has even delayed his own organization's congress in order to accompany Trump on a trip to the Middle East earlier in 2025.\n\nMost recently, Infantino surfaced in Egypt alongside Trump for the Gaza summit. The Fifa Club World Cup trophy and the Fifa men's World Cup trophy, gifts from Infantino, have both found seemingly permanent spots among Trump's Oval Office decor.\n\nThat has not stopped Trump from threatening the removal of World Cup games from other US host cities. On 25 September, Seattle and the San Francisco came in his crosshairs, with Trump saying both cities were \"run by radical left lunatics who don't know what they're doing\", while criticizing the safety level of both locales and claiming that games could be removed.\n\nFifa vice-president Victor Monatgliani rebuffed Trump's claims when he responded days later at a conference in London.\n\n\"It's Fifa's tournament, Fifa's jurisdiction, Fifa makes those decisions,\" Montagliani said. \"With all due respect to current world leaders, football is bigger than them and football will survive their regime and their government and their slogans. That's the beauty of our game, that it is bigger than any individual and bigger than any country.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump's answer to a question about Boston veered into a similar threat to the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.\n\n\"If I thought LA was not going to be prepared properly, I would move it to another location if I had to,\" he said. \"On that one I'd probably have to get a different kind of a permission, but we would do that.\"\n\nThe permission Trump refers to would need to come through the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Their president, Kirsty Coventry, was elected to her position in March and has yet to hold a public appearance with Trump, though she said that she would like a sit-down with him at some point.\n\nTrump also criticized California governor Gavin Newsom's handling of this year's LA wildfires, saying that a similar situation could result in the removal of the Games.\n\n\"If he doesn't play ball, we're gonna have to be very tough,\" Trump said.\n\nHis message was similarly clear for Boston.\n\n\"Boston better clean up their act, he said. \"That's all I can say.\"</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.8686251032272442,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Donald Trump\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"Former President of the United States\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"We could take them away.

Of those, 48 are still believed to be in captivity.\n\nA list of the names of the hostages remaining in Gaza - many of whom are believed to be dead - was read aloud by members of the group alongside Ryvchin.\n\nElsewhere in Sydney, hundreds of members of the Jewish community came together for moments of sombre reflection in Dover Heights' Rodney Reserve and on a beach in the city's east at dawn, marking the moment Hamas's attack began.\n\nCommemorations fall on the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, a traditional day of rest. A larger community vigil, with thousands expected to be in attendance in Sydney's east, is planned for Sunday evening.\n\nAnthony Albanese said Australia stood with the Jewish community, \"who feel the cold shadow of history's darkest chapter in any act of antisemitism\".\n\n\"We will always stand against antisemitism, and so should everyone,\" the prime minister said.\n\nHe used the moment to underline Australia's support for Donald Trump's peace plan to end the conflict, for which negotiations are under way in Egypt.\n\n\"It is our duty to do everything in our power to see a just and lasting peace in the Middle East,\" he said.\n\nThe deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, said the day was \"not a day for demonstrations\".\n\n\"Today is a day for remembrance and commemoration ... This is a very difficult day for the Jewish community in Australia and it is a very solemn day,\" he told the ABC.\n\nThe Australian National Imams Council used the occasion to call for sanctions on Israel and \"the immediate end to the genocide and the killing of innocent civilians\".\n\nIn Melbourne, the defacing of a billboard with pro-Hamas graffiti was being looked into as a possible terror offence, Marles said.\n\nThe incident has been widely condemned, including by the New Israel Fund, which called the \"deliberate provocation, timed to coincide with a day of immense grief for Israelis and Jews around the world ... an affront to our shared values\".\n\nPro-Palestinian supporters are expected to hold a vigil in Melbourne on Tuesday evening while a protest for Gaza is planned in western Sydney.\n\nOn Monday, about 1,000 people attended a vigil by the Palestine Action Group at Sydney's Town Hall, according to Damian Ridgwell, an activist within the group.\n\nThose in attendance included many of Palestinian and Middle Eastern backgrounds, representatives of the local Indigenous community, Jews against the occupation, and the Teachers Federation, Ridgwell said.\n\n\"We've had a great turnout of people who've come to commemorate two years of this genocide. A lot of people, as you would imagine, furious that Israel has been allowed to get away with committing this genocide for two years because of the complicity and inaction of governments like our own,\" he said.\n\n\"It's been part of the massive movement we've seen all around the country for the last two years that have been demanding our government actually act and sanction Israel and stop arming them in their genocide against the Palestinians.\"\n\nRidgwell said the group did not avoid putting the vigil on October 7 but chose Monday evening because it was a public holiday and more convenient.\n\n\"There is nothing wrong with Palestinians coming out to mark this. The attempts to try and say that people should not demonstrate on the year anniversary - this is a cynical attempt to try and dehumanise the many, many Palestinians who've been killed now by ruthless bombardment by the Israeli military,\" he said.\n\nRidgwell said despite reports about the ceasefire discussions, it was important to make the point that Israel was continuing to kill Palestinians.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.33107812608386517,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Alex Ryvchin\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Executive Council of Australian Jewry\",\n    \"role\": \"co-CEO\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"will never forget nor forgive what Hamas did on this day two years ago, and what it continues to do, we live in hope that the hostages will soon be free\",\n    \"message\": \"We will never forget nor forgive the actions of Hamas from two years ago and their ongoing actions, and we live in hope that the hostages will soon be free.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Alex Ryvchin\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Executive Council of Australian Jewry\",\n    \"role\": \"co-CEO\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"everything from the terrifying to the absurd\",\n    \"message\": \"The Jewish community has experienced a wide range of situations, from terrifying to absurd, over the past two years.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Alex Ryvchin\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Executive Council of Australian Jewry\",\n    \"role\": \"co-CEO\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"incite yet more hatred against our community\",\n    \"message\": \"The planned pro-Palestinian protest will incite further hatred against the Jewish community.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Alex Ryvchin\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Executive Council of Australian Jewry\",\n    \"role\": \"co-CEO\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"national landmark, at great public expense -

Similar proposals were voted down by the House of Lords as a late amendment at report stage of the public order bill in January 2023. It is unlikely that their lordships will be any more welcoming of these plans this time.\n\nFirst, the announcement came only a few days after the closure of an invitation-only consultation; the speed indicates an already made-up mind. Second, part of the case for expansion of powers is the need to deal with protests that intimidate local people in an area, yet the power to impose conditions on the basis of planned intimidation has existed in public order law since 1986.\n\nThere is also a raft of other provisions that already empower the police to regulate protests: those based on serious disruption to the local community, those based on significant noise, powers to disperse based on reasonable grounds to think that there will be harassment, alarm or distress, and powers to deal with individuals who incite hatred based on race or religion.\n\nLastly, as with all police discretionary powers, is the risk of overreach and of chilling the lawful speech of others. One real danger is that one protest group might be denied their rights because of the actions (say the previous day) of another group. That calls into question the individual nature of the right and the need for individualised assessment of risks and harms for restrictions to be proportionate.\n\nProf David Mead, Dr Suzanne Dixon, Dr Charmian Werren and Jack Jones\n\nUniversity of East Anglia Law School\n\nI have thought deeply about Owen Jones' article (It starts with Palestine protests. But where will the crackdown on Britain's democratic freedoms end?, 6 October).\n\nI was arrested on Saturday with hundreds of others at the Defend Our Juries action in Trafalgar Square, against genocide and the proscription of Palestine Action. It was also the 89th anniversary of the arrest of my father for being one of the organisers of the 1936 Cable Street resistance to the rise of fascism in Britain.\n\nBesides the obligatory \"I oppose genocide, I support Palestine action\", I carried an extra placard saying: \"This Jew abhors the Gaza genocide and the Manchester synagogue attack.\"\n\nCalling opposition to genocide antisemitic is always ignorant and sometimes wicked.

It is unlikely that their lordships will be any more welcoming of these plans this time. First, the announcement came only a few days after the closure of an invitation-only consultation; the speed indicates an already made-up mind. Second, part of the case for expansion of powers is the need to deal with protests that intimidate local people in an area, yet the power to impose conditions on the basis of planned intimidation has existed in public order law since 1986. There is also a raft of other provisions that already empower the police to regulate protests: those based on serious disruption to the local community, those based on significant noise, powers to disperse based on reasonable grounds to think that there will be harassment, alarm or distress, and powers to deal with individuals who incite hatred based on race or religion. Lastly, as with all police discretionary powers, is the risk of overreach and of chilling the lawful speech of others. One real danger is that one protest group might be denied their rights because of the actions (say the previous day) of another group.

Now the threequel is the festival's opening gala: Josh O'Connor is the principled young priest who finds himself in the frame when his fierce clerical superior is whacked - and Benoit has to find out the truth.\n\nOne of the best films of the year - perhaps the best. Brazilian director Kleber Mendonça Filho sets his expansive, freewheeling dramedy-thriller during the 1970s Brazilian dictatorship and Wagner Moura plays a dissident scientist on the run from government forces who want to dispose of him. With its visual brilliance, sensual big-city intrigue and languorous mystery it feels like Elmore Leonard mixed with Antonioni's The Passenger.\n\nAn eerie and unwholesome spell is cast in this fairytale of deathwish yearning and erotic submission from Lucile Hadžihalilović, whose partner Gaspar Noé has a cameo as a seedy movie director. A teen runaway in 60s France with an obsession with Hans Christian Andersen's Snow Queen breaks into a movie studio where this story is actually being filmed starring a magnificently chilly Marion Cotillard: it's a dreamy and narcotic melodrama.\n\nJarmusch won the Venice Golden Lion with this diverting and beguiling anthology movie, whose cast includes Adam Driver, Charlotte Rampling, Indya Moore, Cate Blanchett and Tom Waits. It's a triptych of family scenes: separate scenarios with mischievous, mysterious moments in which they appear to cosmically resonate with each other.\n\nProlific Greek auteur Yorgos Lanthimos is back with another macabre, startling and amusing film featuring his superstar muse Emma Stone. It's a bizarre black comedy about online conspiracy delusion whose final, sensational montage of images sent Venice audiences reeling out of the auditorium. Stone plays an icy corporate CEO who is kidnapped by crazed eco-activist Jesse Plemons who is convinced she is an evil space alien.\n\nMexican auteur Michel Franco can be relied to deliver the shock factor, and so it proves again with this hypnotically disturbing, chilling satire-nightmare of erotic obsession among the liberal superrich in the US. Jessica Chastain plays a wealthy, entitled heiress (like one of the Roy family in TV's Succession) who conceives an erotic obsession with one of the ballet stars in the dance school her family bankrolls.\n\nA creative take on the private life of William Shakespeare needs audacity -- and director Chloé Zhao has boldly taken on Maggie O'Farrell's novel about young William, his wife Anne Hathaway and the imagined heartbreak caused by the death of his young son Hamnet, that name so close to that of his great tragic hero. Paul Mescal is Shakespeare and as the grieving Anne, Jessie Buckley is already being spoken of as a best actress contender at the Academy Awards.\n\nThis docufictional movie had tearful audiences on their feet at Venice: Tunisian film-maker Kaouther Ben Hania recounts the true story of the five-year-old Palestinian girl Hind Rajab, who was stranded in her uncle's car during a 2024 assault by the Israel Defense Forces in Gaza, and desperately stayed on the phone for hours to the Palestine Red Crescent Society, begging for help before she was killed, with many others. Ben Hania uses the real audio recording of the girl's voice and has actors playing the agonised staff on the other end of the line.\n\nBig performances, big emotions and big scenes in this movie from Lynne Ramsay, who brings the gothic realist steam heat to this study of a lonely, passionate woman played by Jennifer Lawrence - a performance which brings back memories of Gena Rowlands' work for Cassavetes. Lawrence's character has postpartum depression, left alone in the house all day with the baby, supposedly writing a novel, while her husband (Robert Pattinson) absents himself.\n\nHere's an art heist movie with a downbeat vibe: Kelly Reichardt gives us a non-hero who is anything but a mastermind here, wonderfully played by Josh O'Connor. He's the art school dropout in the 1960s who conceives a bizarre get-rich-quick scheme: using his wealthy parents' money, he pays a couple of tough guys and a getaway driver to help him steal paintings from a local gallery.\n\nClaire Foy stars in this adaptation of the classic of nature-writing and memoir. She is Helen who suffers a near breakdown when her father dies and to process her grief and loss, trains a fierce goshawk named Mabel, which is as unsentimental a beast as could possibly be imagined - much prized for hunting. It's a film perhaps to set alongside Kes?\n\nIranian director and democracy campaigner Jafar Panahi continues to work, continues to be harassed by the authorities, and won the Cannes Palme d'Or this year with this satirical suspenser about state violence and revenge. A man suffers an accident at night when his car hits a dog and the careworn mechanic helping out realises with a chill that he knows this man - and he must now exact revenge on him.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-34.80365753173828,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"[]"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP"}],"createTime":"2025-10-15T10:37:06.609413Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"UnnvaIWZJdmXmecP3ISXmAw","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1}],"promptTokenCount":1502,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1502}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1485,"totalTokenCount":2988,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}}}

And frontbench politicians are taking note\n\nGood morning. A few decades ago, it was pretty obvious who was in a far-right group. Maybe they had a skinhead, an 88 tattoo or were part of the National Front. Most likely, they knew as well as anyone that their own views were fringe. No more.\n\nLast year, people took to the streets in Southport, setting a mosque, a Citizen's Advice Bureau and a police van (among other things) on fire and smashing the windows of a hotel housing asylum seekers. Some of those arrested had been active on Facebook groups run by ordinary members of the public: people happy to post what once would have been viewed as extreme thoughts openly on Facebook.\n\nThis sort of merging of extremism with everyday life is snowballing. During Conservative party conference, the Guardian revealed one of the most senior Tories had been recorded admitting dismay at not seeing enough white faces in a town - and when the leader of the party was asked about it, she defended him. And not long ago, whether Rishi Sunak was truly \"English\" became a hot topic thanks to those extreme views being aired by those in discussion with former Spectator editor Fraser Nelson and Michael Gove.\n\nHow did views once thought of as far-right become a part of mainstream debate? I asked Pamela Duncan, data projects editor at the Guardian, who has spent a year studying this exact phenomenon. Our discussion is after the headlines.\n\nAfter the Southport riots last year, when around two dozen people were arrested due to social media posts relating to them, Pamela sat down with a question: in what sort of online culture were those people immersed?\n\n\"Our mentality was, if those comments had reached a criminal bar ... what sort of environment were they participating in where could these things could be said?\" she said.\n\nThe data team found the public-facing Facebook profiles of those charged, and 16 different groups in their broader network, interlinked via common admins and moderators running them. They examined the posts of those groups, and found that many, knowingly or not, were interacting with content which one expert said \"echoed fascist methods used throughout history\".\n\nThere was a wide range of activity on the groups but most worrying were posts that followed a pattern of dehumanisation and demonisation of migrants - accounting for one-in-10 posts captured by the Guardian - Muslims and non-white people - who were often portrayed as dangerous, deceitful, criminal or culturally incompatible with UK life.\n\nSome posts used subtle insinuations about \"military-aged men\" and \"grooming gangs\" - as a sort of coded language for the inherent threat that immigrants pose. Others simply labelled all immigrants as \"illegals\" or an \"invasion\". Some were plain racist. Other key themes emerged: of a deep distrust in the government and its institutions, misinformation and conspiracy theories, many containing far-right tropes as well as evidence of white nativism.\n\nNow Pamela says she has seen similar language being used by mainstream politicians.\n\n\"I've been watching a lot of what's coming out of the [party] conferences in the past few weeks, and what's struck me has been that the kind of rhetoric we are seeing in these groups is now being reflected in mainstream speeches,\" says Pamela.\n\nMost obvious are the comments coming out of the Reform conference - in particular, Pamela points to people like Zia Yusuf, who spoke about the \"invasion of our country\" by \"tens of thousands of fighting aged males\".\n\nShocking, perhaps, but also maybe what to expect of Reform. What's more astonishing is how it has bled into the discourse within the Conservative party recently.\n\nNo white faces\n\nI almost choked on my cornflakes on Tuesday morning, listening to Kemi Badenoch respond to comments that Robert Jenrick, the shadow secretary for justice, made about Handsworth at a dinner in the West Midlands. He compared the area to a slum, and stated he \"hadn't seen another white face\" in the 90 minutes he was there, adding: \"that's not the country I want to live in\".\n\nAppearing on Radio 4's Today Programme, Badenoch first suggested the Guardian's recording could have been taken out of context, adding: \"What really worries me is that there are a lot of people in Birmingham who are not integrating.\" Pressed on whether the number of white people you see in an area is a good measure of integration, Badenoch said: \"I'm making a far more important point ... What I don't want is for us to not say anything because everybody's scared about offending someone else, and then we end up having huge scandals like the grooming scandal where I remember a parent telling me that she was arrested because the police said she was racist because she pointed out that her child had gotten into a car with Asian men.\"\n\nI asked Pamela whether this sort of rhetoric chimes with what she's seen posted on far-right Facebook groups.\n\n\"This idea of grooming gangs, military aged men - these are the new dog whistles, and they are the tell tale signs,\" she said.\n\nAnother thing the team found was how these Facebook groups drove anti-establishment ideas, and experts said that this language ultimately ends up benefiting Reform. That mistrust of institutions grew into something more insidious in the wake of the riots: with people posting in support of the Southport rioters, and taking issue with people being jailed for online offences.\n\nIn her closing speech at party conference, Badenoch also seemed to take offence at the law being used against people who have said illegal things online: \"Hundreds of thousands of police hours are wasted every year on non-crime hate incidents and form filling officers chasing tweets instead of thieves,\" she said.\n\nCould the Tories be seeking to benefit from the same anti-establishment rhetoric that Reform has, now that they're no longer in power? Judging intent is always hard, says Pamela, but the signals are clear. She points to Jenrick doing a bit with a periwig at conference, and talking about supposed links between judges who support open borders and their rulings.\n\n\"I was really shocked by Jenrick taking out the wig and undermining how judges are appointed, talking about two-tier sentencing rules and guidelines. That's something that we saw reflected in our research as well,\" Pamela says.\n\nIllusory effect\n\nOne of the problems with the way far-right rhetoric has spread on social media is that many people - faced with the same information again and again - start to think \"if I've seen it so many times, it must be true\".\n\nBut considering the amount of misinformation there is online, compounded with the widespread failure of social media companies to moderate this sort of content on their platforms, the danger is that people increasingly live in worlds where they believe fringe, often verifiably false views are more popular than they are. As Prof Sander van der Linden, an expert in the impact of conspiracy and misinformation and its connection to extremism put it in our reporting: \"You may be able to find two people in your neighbourhood who feel the same way, but now you can connect with thousands of individuals who feel the same way as you in a matter of seconds, which leads to a misperception about what the consensus is in society.\"\n\nBut what is the impact when similar rhetoric comes from the leaders of mainstream parties?\n\n\"It definitely feeds into the normalisation of this language,\" says Pamela. \"There is a validation when it's put in the mouths of more serious politicians. They are getting airtime, and their quotes will be clipped and posted, put on television and will be heard, potentially, by millions.\"\n\nShe adds that it's not just Reform - with their references to \"invasions\" of migrants during party conference - that are guilty of this.\n\n\"We saw it even with Keir Starmer, with his speech on us becoming a nation of strangers not so long ago,\" she says. The prime minister may now say he regrets those words, but \"we should not forget that he said them,\" says Pamela.\n\n\"The breadth of the problem seems so great, and nobody seems to be hitting the brakes on it,\" she continues. \"It just seems to be getting worse and worse.\"\n\nFootball | A narrow 2-1 victory over Belarus was enough for an unimpressive Scotland to edge closer to World Cup qualification.

They include 28 French citizens, 27 Greeks, 15 Italians, and nine Swedes.\n\nA first group of 26 Italians left Israel on Saturday. After returning to their country many said they were subjected to degrading treatment by Israeli authorities.\n\nThe families of the three New Zealanders told media on Monday they were concerned for the safety and wellbeing of their loved ones.\n\n\"I'm very worried about Samuel, as he sits in a cell right now, in a cage crammed in with many other people ... he has been without water and legal representation,\" said Adrian Leason, Samuel's father.\n\nHeba Hamida said her sister Rana had sustained an injury to her shoulder, but the family were unclear yet as to how it happened.\n\n\"I'm just going to ask the government to react and bring our loved ones home safe and in good health,\" Hamida said.\n\nYoussef's sister, Samar Sammour, said her brother had sailed into danger, not because he wanted to but because the government had failed to act.\n\n\"I urge the New Zealand government to demonstrate principled leadership that defines us as a nation and to finally show the moral courage that people like Youssef, Rana and Samuel have shown in abundance.\"\n\nNew Zealand's ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement a consular partner in Tel Aviv had met with the New Zealanders and the ministry would provide further support in the coming days.\n\nIt said it was not aware of any New Zealanders being on the most recent deportation flight.\n\nIsrael's foreign ministry has denied accusations that some activists were denied access to their lawyers and said the legal rights of the activists were being \"fully upheld\".\n\nAdalah, a legal centre in Israel representing the activists, said some of those detained have alleged abuse and physical violence while in Israeli custody. Other accusations of mistreatment include being denied medical treatment and medication, and in one case, a Muslim woman was allegedly forced to remove her hijab and was offered a shirt as a replacement.\n\nAsked about the allegations, an Israeli foreign ministry spokesperson accused Adalah of \"repeating outright lies\".\n\n\"All the detainees' legal rights were fully upheld, and they were all given access to water, food, and restrooms. They were not denied access to legal counsel, and of course, no physical force was used against them,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe co-leader of New Zealand's Green Party, Chlöe Swarbrick, told a press conference the detained New Zealanders were trying to build a world \"in which our humanity actually means something\".\n\nThe party demanded the government make clear its plans for returning the New Zealanders, and called on prime minister Christopher Luxon to sanction Israel.\n\n\"Our government has a legal obligation to prevent genocide. It is presently washing its hands of that obligation,\" Swarbrick said.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Monday afternoon, Luxon said officials had conveyed \"very strongly to the Israeli government\" that the safety of New Zealanders was paramount.\n\nLuxon would not condemn Israel's interception of the flotilla because there were \"arguments on both sides\".\n\n\"You're going into a war zone ... there's 40 boats and 500 people, you could argue they're trying to keep people safe.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in a lengthy post to X, foreign affairs minister Winston Peters accused Swarbrick of \"faux moral outrage\" and said the members of the flotilla were \"headline hunting\" and had been told not to go.\n\n\"Now we have to spend all of our time and taxpayer money to solve their self righteous self inflicted petulant problems,\" he said.\n\nThe Guardian has contacted the Israeli embassy in New Zealand for comment.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.2749792862244387,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Adrian Leason\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"Samuel's father\",\n    \"nationality\": \"NZL\",\n    \"quote\": \"I'm very worried about Samuel, as he sits in a cell right now, in a cage crammed in with many other people ... he has been without water and legal representation.\",\n    \"message\": \"I am very worried about Samuel, who is currently being held in a crowded cell without access to water or legal representation.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Heba Hamida\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"Rana's sister\",\n    \"nationality\": \"NZL\",\n    \"quote\": \"I'm just going to ask the government to react and bring our loved ones home safe and in good health.\",\n    \"message\": \"I am asking the New Zealand government to take action and ensure the safe and healthy return of our loved ones.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Samar Sammour\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"Youssef's sister\",\n    \"nationality\": \"NZL\",\n    \"quote\": \"I urge the New Zealand government to demonstrate principled leadership that defines us as a nation and to finally show the moral courage that people like Youssef, Rana and Samuel have shown in abundance.\",\n    \"message\": \"The New Zealand government should demonstrate principled leadership, which defines our nation, and finally show the moral courage that people like Youssef, Rana, and Samuel have shown in abundance.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Israeli foreign ministry spokesperson\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Israel's foreign ministry\",\n    \"role\": \"spokesperson\",\n    \"nationality\": \"ISR\",\n    \"quote\": \"repeating outright lies\",\n    \"message\": \"Adalah is repeating outright lies.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Israeli foreign ministry spokesperson\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Israel's foreign ministry\",\n    \"role\": \"spokesperson\",\n    \"nationality\": \"ISR\",\n    \"quote\": \"All the detainees' legal rights were fully upheld, and they were all given access to water, food, and restrooms.

On Thursday, the yellow stickers remained but the tally was gone. In its place was a simple phrase: \"They're coming home.\"\n\nGone were the protest slogans Israelis had chanted for the last two years, calling on their government to secure the release of hostages. In their place were marching bands and crowds singing about the imminent return of their loved ones.\n\n\"I felt good when I heard the news, but I will feel much better when I see Eitan and the rest of the hostages. With God's help, he will return on Monday from hell,\" said Itzik Horn, a 73-year-old whose son is one of the 20 living hostages held by Hamas.\n\nAs he spoke a man blew a shofar - a ram's horn that in Judaism represents faith and hope for the future - to the cheers of a surrounding crowd. People smiled as they looked at the photos of hostages that lined the square, hopeful that they might soon see some of their faces in person.\n\nJust hours before, Israel and Hamas signed a deal to release all of the remaining living hostages held in Gaza in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners by Monday, while the remains of some 28 dead hostages would be returned when conditions allowed. Israeli forces would also partially withdraw from the Gaza strip to prepare for the hostage release.\n\nTo the families of the hostages, news of the agreement was an end to a nightmare they had lived for two years.\n\n\"All this time we went through hell. I felt that I was kidnapped - it's true I wasn't taken to the Hamas tunnels - but they also kidnapped me,\" said Horn. His other son, Iair, had also been taken hostage, but was released during a ceasefire in February. Iair has been free for six months, but he is still unableto talk about his experience in captivity. When he tries, he is overcome by emotion and cannot speak.\n\nWhile the ceasefire announcement was the closest negotiators had come to ending the two-year war in Gaza, which has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians and seen Israel accused of genocide, a permanent ceasefire was still a ways off.\n\nThe rest of Donald Trump's 20-point plan, including disarmament of Hamas and the establishment of a transitional authority to govern Gaza, had yet to be agreed upon by negotiators. Israel continued to bomb the Gaza strip well into Thursday morning.\n\nTo most Israelis, however, the release of hostages was the focus. The rest was just details.\n\n\"I'm feeling fantastic, it feels like I'm in a dream. Two years of this, who would have thought that it would finally happen?\" Margo Orton, a retired nursery teacher, said as she waved both an Israeli and an American flag. \"Thank God for America and for Trump, if it wasn't for them, they wouldn't be coming home at all.\"\n\nThe sentiment was shared among the hundreds of Israelis who rallied in Tel Aviv on Thursday. Mention of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was mostly met with a scoff or even venom. Most protesters viewed him as having had elongated the war for his own political interests.\n\nMention of Trump, by contrast, evoked cries of praise, with people in Hostage Square wearing the ubiquitous \"Make America Great Again\" cap and even Trump masks. Earlier in the day, crowds chanted for the US president to receive the Nobel peace prize - something the US president has made little secret that he covets.\n\nStill, some were still cautious in their optimism, reserving celebrations for when the hostages actually make it home. Agreements between Israel and Hamas were always fragile and had collapsed in the past; a ceasefire earlier had ended suddenly in mid-March when Israel unilaterally decided to resume hostilities in Gaza.\n\n\"I don't trust anyone, I am a survivor of October 7. I just have to hope that - now that America is involved. Until we see everyone, all 48 of them, I won't believe it,\" said Sharon Kalderon, whose brother-in-law and his two children were held hostage by Hamas but released in an earlier hostage release.\n\nPalestinians were similarly reticent about talks of a ceasefire, having had their hopes dashed more than once. If talks over the thornier details of the plan collapsed, so could prospects for a lasting peace.\n\nTo many Israelis, whether fighting resumed in Gaza or not was of little consequence to them once hostages were already safe at home.\n\n\"We will clear all of Gaza and Hamas and send them to their 72 virgins. Israel will catch every one of them, you will see,\" said Orton, laughing as she referenced an Islamaphobic trope.\n\nAs afternoon dragged on, Israelis continued to show up, cheering as the families of hostages emerged on the steps of the library that overlooked Hostage Square. Most attendees hoped it would be the last time that they would be rallying in the square, which for two years had become a source of national unity through pain.\n\nHorn had already began planning what he was going to say to his son when he returned home on Monday. The heavyset 38-year-old had appeared significantly thinner in videos released by Hamas during his captivity.\n\n\"I am going to tell him that he took it a little too far with the diet,\" Horn said, laughing.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.8630362165735123,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Itzik Horn\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"ISR\",\n    \"quote\": \"I felt good when I heard the news, but I will feel much better when I see Eitan and the rest of the hostages.

From arrests to bans, free-speech boundaries are shifting\n\nThe ceasefire between Hamas and Israel has been met with joy and relief across the Middle East and beyond. Over the past two years, outrage at Israel's war in Gaza has erupted across Europe and the US, manifesting itself in university campus protests, massive marches through countless capitals and the disruption of major sporting events.\n\nEven as hopes rise of an end to the war, international anger over Israel's actions in Gaza, which have been deemed a genocide by a UN commission of inquiry, remains raw, as evidenced by last weekend's huge rallies in Spain and Italy.\n\nWhile the fury that fuels them has been shared and ubiquitous, the demonstrations - and the authorities' responses to them - have varied considerably from country to country. If some of the official reactions have been draconian, there have also been exceptions, especially in countries where public opinion is more openly pro-Palestinian.\n\nIn the US, growing pro-Palestinian activism has been met with arrests, legal action, and mounting threats, offering a pretext for the Trump administration's unprecedented attack on free speech and catalysing what many view as the country's descent into authoritarianism.\n\nIn the early months of the war, thousands of people - many of them Jewish - took part in protests. After students at Columbia University set up a pro-Palestinian encampment on campus in the spring of 2024, dozens more followed at other universities across the country. But bowing to pressure from legislators, donors, and pro-Israel critics, many universities responded harshly to the encampments, calling police on to campuses which lead to thousands of arrests.\n\nMeanwhile, allegations of antisemitism against pro-Palestinian protests have been weaponised by the Trump administration to launch an unprecedented assault on academic freedom, including billions in cuts to universities, the screening of thousands of visa applicants for pro-Palestinian views, and the detention and attempted deportation of foreign scholars over their political views.\n\nIn the UK, the Metropolitan police have so far arrested more than 1,900 people at pro-Palestinian events, the vast majority of whom have been detained for allegedly expressing support for Palestine Action, a direct action group that has been proscribed under anti-terrorism legislation. The UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, has called for the ban to be rescinded, describing it as \"disproportionate and unnecessary\".\n\nThe prime minister, Keir Starmer, who described plans for protests on the second anniversary of the 7 October attacks as \"un-British\", has said his government will look at further curbs on protests, including potential powers to take action against specific chants at pro-Palestinian demonstrations. Starmer also urged protesters to show respect by calling off their activities in the immediate aftermath of the Manchester synagogue terror attack, in which two people died.\n\nIn Germany, whose postwar identity has been indelibly shaped by the Nazi regime's responsibility for the Holocaust, the protests have revealed tensions between popular feeling and the country's longstanding solidarity with Israel.\n\nEven as public opinion has turned against the Israeli government's relentless assault on Gaza - a recent pro-Palestinian rally in Berlin attracted about 100,000 demonstrators - successive German governments have reaffirmed the principle that responsibility for Israel's security is part of Berlin's own Staatsräson, or reason of state.\n\nActivists have repeatedly said that police tactics have been excessive, at times brutal, and in violation of constitutional protections of freedom of assembly and expression.\n\nMuch of the dispute between pro-Palestinian demonstrators and German authorities has centred around which slogans are banned under the law as antisemitic.\n\nIn May last year, a pro-Palestinian activist was convicted of condoning a crime for using the chant, \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free\", at a rally four days after the 7 October attacks. The judge said she \"could not comprehend\" the logic of previous German court rulings that determined the saying was \"ambiguous\", saying to her it was clear it \"denied the right of the state of Israel to exist\".\n\nThis chant however has also been widely used to call for equal rights both in Israel and Palestine.\n\nWhen asked about crackdowns on pro-Palestinian activism after an alleged case of brutality against an Irish protester, Berlin police this month said they had opened an investigation against the officer but denied a pattern of violence or infringement of civil rights.\n\nArtists and intellectuals have cited a chilling effect in Germany around support for the Palestinian cause since the 7 October attacks, as criticism of Israeli tactics in Gaza can be quickly smeared as antisemitism, resulting in the withdrawal of prizes, positions and public funding.\n\nMeanwhile many Jewish leaders in Germany have described a sense of isolation since over the last two years and point to a sharp rise in attacks on Jews and Jewish institutions.\n\nIn May this year, the French interior ministry announced it would dissolve the pro-Palestinian human rights and solidarity collective, Urgence Palestine, stating that it condoned Hamas, called for intifada in France, and provoked hatred, violence and discrimination against Jewish people. Urgence Palestine has contested these allegations, saying that the move to dissolve them was politically motivated and part of a wider crackdown on pro-Palestinian activism. The collective has not yet been dissolved.\n\nMarie Laure Geoffray, freedoms advocacy officer for Amnesty International France, said there had been \"significant repression and a silencing of voices in solidarity with Palestine\" and this was \"ongoing\".\n\nShe said this had taken various forms in France, including the banning of some street demonstrations in certain cities, the decision to dissolve Urgence Palestine, as well as legal action. Geoffray said students on French campuses had also been accused of disrupting the peace or troubling the public order.\n\nThe extent of Italian public opinion against Israel's war in Gaza became evident on 22 September, when tens of thousands of people took to the streets calling for an end to the conflict as part of a general strike coordinated by trade unions.\n\nThe mostly peaceful event was overshadowed by clashes between police and masked protesters at Milan's central train station, giving the prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, an opportunity to condemn the \"shameful\" scenes and attack her leftwing opponents rather than show solidarity with the Palestinians.\n\nThe pressure on Meloni ramped up further when Israel's interception of the Global Sumud Flotilla triggered protests across Italy nine days later. Rome's police said at least 250,000 people turned out for a march, which came a day after more than 2 million people took part in a one-day general strike to support Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nMeloni's government is mindful of public opinion, and in recent months has become increasingly critical of Israel's killing of Palestinians - even as Italy remains one of Israel's strongest EU allies. Meloni now says Italy would recognise a Palestinian state if the remaining Israeli hostages are freed and the militant group Hamas is out of government.\n\nIn Ireland, which joined Spain and Norway in formally recognising a Palestinian state in May 2024, the police force, An Garda Síochána, has mostly applied a light touch to Gaza protests, which usually pass without incident.\n\nGovernment policy and public opinion are strongly pro-Palestinian, which creates a supportive atmosphere for marches and rallies.\n\n\"Overall it's kind of hands-off policing,\" said Zoë Lawlor, chair of the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign. \"National demonstrations pass off fine. In Limerick we have a demonstration every week and we never see the Garda unless the far right show up too. Otherwise we just steward ourselves.\"\n\nPolice have on occasion been \"heavy-handed\" when dealing with sit-ins and other acts of civil disobedience but that did not compare with the \"shocking\" police behaviour in some other countries, said Lawlor.\n\nIreland enjoyed greater freedom to protest than in countries such as the UK, US and Germany, but Irish policing still required monitoring, said Joe O'Brien, executive director of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties. \"We have heard testimony, including allegations of unnecessary strip-searches and a cavity search, that raises serious concerns regarding Garda compliance with human rights frameworks and national law, regulations and policies governing the treatment of people in custody.\"\n\nIn May, the then-Garda commissioner Drew Harris said allegations of strip-searches were inaccurate and that his force at all times had acted professionally and lawfully.\n\nSpain, meanwhile, has proved something of an exception when it comes to government support for protests.\n\nNot long after more than 100,000 pro-Palestinian demonstrators forced a premature, scrappy and sporadically violent end to the Vuelta a España cycle race in Madrid last month, due to the participation of the Israel Premier Tech team, senior Spanish politicians lined up to bemoan the damage the protest had done to the country's global reputation.\n\nFigures in the conservative People's party called the episode \"an international embarrassment\" and compared scenes on the streets of Madrid to \"Sarajevo during the war\".\n\nBut one political figure took a different line. Spain's socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said he had \"a deep admiration\" for all those who had protested in a non-violent manner and for \"a Spanish society that mobilises against injustice and defends its ideas in a peaceful manner\".\n\nSánchez, who had already been fiercely criticised by his adversaries, also said he hoped that the events in Madrid would lead others to reconsider whether Israel should be included in major sporting events.\n\nLast weekend, an estimated 200,000 people rallied across dozens of Spanish cities to show their solidarity with Palestine.\n\nBoth the protests and the prime minister's backing for them demonstrate the strength of public opinion in a country where, according to a recent poll, 82% of people believe Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. Sánchez's conservative opponents have also recently begun to step up their criticisms of Israel's conduct in Gaza, while King Felipe - hardly a habitual courter of controversy - used a speech before the UN last month to beg Israel to \"stop the massacre\" and end its \"abhorrent acts\" in Gaza.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.9136240539984887,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Volker Türk\",\n    \"organisation\": \"United Nations\",\n    \"role\": \"human rights chief\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"disproportionate and unnecessary\",\n    \"message\": \"The ban on Palestine Action is disproportionate and unnecessary.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Keir Starmer\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Government of the United Kingdom\",\n    \"role\": \"prime minister\",\n    \"nationality\": \"GBR\",\n    \"quote\": \"un-British\",\n    \"message\": \"Plans for protests on the second anniversary of the 7 October attacks are un-British.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"The judge\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"judge\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"could not comprehend\",\n    \"message\": \"The judge could not comprehend the logic of previous German court rulings.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"The judge\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"judge\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"denied the right of the state of Israel to exist\",\n    \"message\": \"The judge believed that the chant 'from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free' clearly denied the right of the state of Israel to exist.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Marie Laure Geoffray\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Amnesty International France\",\n    \"role\": \"freedoms advocacy officer\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"significant repression and a silencing of voices in solidarity with Palestine\",\n    \"message\": \"There has been significant repression and a silencing of voices in solidarity with Palestine in France, and this is ongoing.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Giorgia Meloni\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Government of Italy\",\n    \"role\": \"prime minister\",\n    \"nationality\": \"ITA\",\n    \"quote\": \"shameful\",\n    \"message\": \"The scenes of clashes between police and masked protesters at Milan's central train station were shameful.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Zoë Lawlor\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign\",\n    \"role\": \"chair\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"Overall it's kind of hands-off policing.

It was taken as praise, but it soon became clear that it was meant as anything but. My tutor was referring to the student's ability to switch instantly from arguing one position to positing the exact opposite once it became more useful to do so.\n\nI have no idea what career he took up after he graduated, but watching today's BBC coverage of President Trump's visit to Israel I wonder if he became a BBC producer. Because it's startling just how sharply the corporation has switched the tone of its coverage of President Trump. The BBC has demonstrated an extremely supple mind.\n\nFor the past few months, ever since the Donald was sworn in as president for the second term, there has been no doubt about the BBC's stance. Ostensibly, of course, its reporting is neutral. But it's been about as neutral in its coverage of President Trump as it has always been in its coverage of Israel. Deeply partisan, in other words. And it has been thus ever since Donald Trump first emerged as a serious candidate for the Republican nomination in the 2016 campaign.\n\nYou may loathe the man. You may regard him with contempt. But the point of the BBC, and one of the reasons why we are forced to pay the license fee, is not to buttress your loathing of him - or of Israel, or of anyone or anything else - but to report objectively. As if!\n\nBut if there is anyone the BBC despises more than Donald Trump it is Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister. For the BBC, Bibi-hate trumps Donald-hate, as it were. And today's coverage of the return of the hostages, the Gaza deal and President Trump's speech to the Knesset has shown just how supple its correspondents' minds have had to be in order to maintain the BBC's hate rankings. With Netanyahu top of that hate-tree, anyone who puts the Israeli leader in his place is praise-worthy. So BBC correspondents have had to do the previously unthinkable and credit Donald Trump with something. Even the BBC, after all, can't pretend that the Gaza deal is in spite of the president, rather than because of him. So they have had to make not so much an intellectual leap as a sudden change in slant.\n\nToday we have heard a different story across the BBC. Today it is no longer presenting Trump only as a cartoon-like villain; today the story being rammed home by the corporation is how Trump finally lost his temper with Bibi after the failed attempt to assassinate Hamas leaders in Qatar and forced him - and Israel itself - to come to heel. Trump dumped on Netanyahu and that got the hostages home, according to the BBC's view of events.\n\nAnd so while it hasn't yet gone the whole \"my enemy's enemy is my friend\" hog and started to laud Trump, it has nonetheless, for the first time since he won the presidency in 2016, treated as him as something other than an evil bully. He can't be all bad if he has dumped on Bibi.\n\nInconveniently for the BBC, that received wisdom is deeply misleading. Far from turning on Bibi after the Doha air raid, Trump used it to his and Israel's advantage by responding to the Qataris' pleading for future security guarantees from the US with the demand that they deliver up Hamas in return, which is what happened.\n\nIn reality, it isn't Donald Trump who is cartoon-like. It certainly isn't Benjamin Netanyahu. What's cartoon-like is the BBC's loathing of both - and its view that Bibi-hate beats Trump-hate.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-424.4939880371094,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"[]"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP"}],"createTime":"2025-10-15T10:37:06.626412Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"UnnvaOydJtmXmecP3ISXmAw","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1}],"promptTokenCount":1176,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1176}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1797,"totalTokenCount":2974,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}}}

While any Israeli citizen was held captive in Gaza, there could be no healing of the vast, suppurating wound Hamas inflicted on a nation whose leaders had grown complacent about the threat from the narrow strip on its southwestern flank.\n\nThe concept of \"no-one left behind\" is deeply ingrained in Israel's national and military psyche -- a moral imperative rooted in the Jewish tradition and an obligation many of the thousands who gathered weekly in Tel Aviv's Hostages Square felt Benjamin Netanyahu had forgotten. Mention of the Israeli prime minister's name by Steve Witkoff, Donald Trump's peace envoy, triggered a chorus of boos there on Monday.\n\nThe crowds who began assembling in the square in the pre-dawn hours on Monday morning to watch the handover of the last remaining living hostages hope this will be the final time they need to gather.\n\nOn this long-yearned-for day, politics will be set aside. There have been hostage releases before -- but none as emotional as this, the bookend to perhaps the most traumatic chapter in Israel's history.\n\nAll those held in Gaza's dank, airless tunnels have suffered. But none more than this final batch, who endured captivity for so long, starved of sunlight and food, held at time in chains, according to hostage support groups.\n\nAnxious relatives can only guess at the depth of the psychological scars their loved ones will bear.\n\n\"I don't know what kind of son I'm going to get back,\" Ilan Gilboa-Dalal told reporters on Sunday evening.\n\nThe last time Mr Gilboa-Dalal glimpsed his son Guy, in a video released by Hamas last month, he saw \"despair in his eyes.\"\n\n\"We saw him not the way we knew him,\" he said. \"It was a different Guy.\"\n\nAs the hostages make their long-awaited journey home, the process of healing -- for their families and for Israel -- can begin, even if the country they return to will be profoundly different to the one they were spirited out of a little more than two years ago.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.4396831288057215,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Ilan Gilboa-Dalal\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"ISR\",\n    \"quote\": \"I don't know what kind of son I'm going to get back,\",\n    \"message\": \"I am uncertain about the physical and mental state my son will be in after his return from captivity.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Ilan Gilboa-Dalal\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"ISR\",\n    \"quote\": \"despair in his eyes.\",\n    \"message\": \"My son, Guy, showed signs of deep despair in his eyes in the video released by Hamas.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Ilan Gilboa-Dalal\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"ISR\",\n    \"quote\": \"We saw him not the way we knew him.

Now 23, she grew up in this tiny community in Israel's farthest south-west tip, and its flower-lined paths hold some of her happiest memories.\n\nIt is also the place where her parents were murdered by Hamas gunmen on 7 October 2023, and her brother Rotem was badly injured. Their mother, Shachar, used her own body to shield him from the bullets, saving his life in a last act of love.\n\n\"I do miss Holit. It's a big question that I ask myself every day, whether I can go back to live there. It seems like I don't have an answer, and I don't think I will be able to get one until I try,\" she said.\n\nThe kibbutz residents were a small, close knit group of about 230 people, ripped apart by the massacre two years ago. Fifteen were killed, including two Thai farm workers, and another six taken hostage. Survivors were all evacuated that same day, when the army arrived in the afternoon.\n\nBarred from returning to their homes for nearly two years, most have since been living in hotels and temporary houses. More than 1,000 cows in the kibbutz dairy are the only permanent residents of a place now given over to ghosts and memories, its entrance guarded by a single bored soldier.\n\nThe playground is covered with two years of dust, paths and patios are overgrown, and the quiet that originally drew residents here is eerily absolute, apart from when Israel bombs Gaza. It is so close, little more than 1 mile away, that big explosions have enough force to crack the ceiling plaster and shake the wires loose in the empty homes.\n\nNow the government has authorised the community's return, and together they have set a date of next July, after the Israeli school year ends. For Nir Sultan, whose parents-in-law were also killed here, that feels both too soon and too far away.\n\nThe attack was the deadliest since Israel was founded, killing 1,200 people, most of them civilians, including - according to Israeli government data - 39 children. Another 251 were taken hostage, the youngest a nine-month-old baby.\n\n\"It seems like a brave thing to do, to return,\" Sultan said. \"On the one hand I don't know if it's enough time, on the other hand I want to come back today, I want to be home.\"\n\nHolit is starting construction of a new kindergarten, intended as a bold vote of confidence that life can return and a tool particularly to draw young families.\n\nThey are advertising for new residents, and have already had some interest from people willing to consider moving in despite the tragedy and the terror, or perhaps because of it. \"Maybe they understand that if we aren't here, it will be a problem for Israel,\" said Sultan.\n\nOriginally established in the 1970s as a settlement in the Sinai peninsula when the area was under Israeli occupation, Holit moved to its current location after a peace deal that restored Egyptian control of the Sinai.\n\nIt is part of a string of communities along the edge of what Israel calls \"the Gaza envelope\" - because of the way it wraps around the thin strip of Palestinian territory along the coast - that are now grappling with how to rebuild and whether to come home.\n\nFounded as part of a state-building project that aimed to contain Gaza by populating its borders, many were rooted in secular, leftwing Zionist tradition. Victims of the 7 October attacks included a large number of peace activists working for coexistence and a Palestinian state.\n\nMatias's parents were among the founders of a bilingual school that taught children in Hebrew and Arabic under the slogan \"Jewish-Arab education for equality\".\n\nTheir neighbour Hayim Katsman, killed protecting another resident, was an academic and activist who spent weekends trying to protect Palestinians in the occupied West Bank from violent settlers.\n\nHis sibling Noy Katsman has repeatedly pleaded that his brother's violent death should not eclipse his life's work, and the family's grief should not be used to justify inflicting pain on Palestinians.\n\nOver the last two years in Gaza, Israeli attacks have killed more than 67,000 people, the vast majority of them civilians, and its blockade created a famine. Genocide scholars, rights groups and a UN commission of inquiry say Israel is committing genocide.\n\nThe attack had a different impact on Sultan, a mother of three who thinks Israel's war is necessary. She still sometimes feels astonished that her family escaped alive after hours hiding in a room without a lock. Her husband held the door shut as gunmen repeatedly tried to force their way in, and she tried to keep their young boys quiet.\n\n\"My dream was that Gaza would open up, and there would be peace,\" she said. \"Now I think only for myself, that I need to save myself and my kids. If I want my kids to grow up properly, I can't let it happen again. And they (Hamas) said it will happen again.\"\n\n\"Chaim [Hayim] Katsman believed in coexistence, and what did it get him?\" she added. \"So it's hard to think differently right now.\"\n\nThe trauma of Holit and other communities attacked on 7 October holds a grim fascination for some Israelis who were isolated from the direct horrors of that day.\n\nSometimes unannounced visitors turn up at the community dairy and ask manager Lior Klajman: \"Tell us how you survived,\" a brutally casual request to relive a day of intense fear and losses that he finds infuriating and disrespectful.\n\nOthers have come to wander through survivors' temporary housing in a nearby kibbutz, treating their upended lives like a visitor attraction, \"just walking there with their dog in the afternoon, to look at us like we are in a zoo\", he said.\n\nSultan once snapped at people gathered to watch her do laundry, letting out a loud mock lion's roar and telling the stunned group: \"If you look at me like I am in the zoo, I'll act like an animal.\"\n\nVisitors who travelled to this area in order to remember 7 October can do it at the site of the Nova rave, where there is a new access road through land that two years ago was scattered with cars and belongings abandoned in terror, and a parking lot for a steady stream of visitors.\n\nHolit's residents don't need a memorial to fix their memories. Walking around with Nir is to see a litany of atrocities. Here is the house where a seven-year-old girl, hiding in a cupboard after her parents were shot, rang neighbours begging to be saved. They risked their own lives to go out and collect her.\n\nHere is the house where Nir's parents-in-law lived and were killed. Ronit was a 55-year-old who brought the colours and glamour of Buenos Aires to Israel, and never stopped studying. She was awarded her doctorate posthumously.\n\nRoland, 68, was gentle and playful, a talented cook and actor who loved clowning around with his grandchildren. A memorial poster shows him smiling under a crown of flowers.\n\nSome of the most badly damaged houses have been pulled down, including Shir Matias's family home, and she has not yet been able to spend the night in Holit. She feels calm when she visits during the day but as night falls it pulls her back towards the horrors of 7 October.\n\nSo she understands why some residents will never return. \"It's very reasonable to not want to go back to the place where your friends and family and neighbours were slaughtered.\"\n\nBut she misses the greenness, the \"amazing sunsets\" and the tranquility of a place so quiet that the only sound was often children running around as they played, \"like the soundtrack of a movie\", and is not ready to say goodbye to the family's home.\n\n\"I really feel my parents' presence there, and I won't go down without a fight. I will give my everything to getting back to Holit and trying to be able to live there.\"</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.3207550048828125,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Shir Matias\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"ISR\",\n    \"quote\": \"I do miss Holit.

That section of the act makes it an offence to \"offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate\" another person or group on the basis of their race, colour, or national or ethnic origin.\n\nIn response, Keane and Riemer, who is also the vice-president of the National Tertiary Education Union at the University of Sydney, have argued that criticising Zionism or Israel is not racist hate speech.\n\nThe matter is yet to go to trial, with Justice Geoffrey Kennett on Monday and Tuesday hearing interlocutory applications to amend Toltz's claims.\n\nOn Tuesday, Jessie Taylor, acting for Keane and Riemer, responded to claims by Toltz's lawyers that Riemer had used \"Zionist\" in a series of posts as a \"pejorative synonym for Jew or Israeli\".\n\n\"This court heard yesterday an extraordinary proposition that Zionism and Jews are so perfectly synonymous that Zionism should be construed as a race for [the] purpose of section 18C,\" she said.\n\nShe said the effect of the imputations was to assert that criticising the state of Israel was also to criticise Jews.\n\n\"What the pleadings do is to assert that in calling for peace in Gaza, calling for ceasefire, Dr Riemer is calling for violence.\"\n\nTaylor told the court they aren't denying that Zionism has been used as a code word to cover up criticisms of Jewish people, but she argued this was not one of these cases.\n\n\"Dr Riemer uses it to describe a political ideology with which he fundamentally disagrees,\" she told the court.\n\nThe day before, Adam Butt, who appeared on behalf of Toltz, urged the judge to focus on the perspective of \"enough or most\" of Jewish Australians. He argued that many Jewish Australians \"experience anti-Zionism as antisemitism\".\n\nToltz and the other applicants have also claimed that the University of Sydney is vicariously liable for an article by Riemer in the Overland literary journal, and a speech and post.\n\nIn the post, Riemer had said \"there's no room for racism, for settler colonialism, for apartheid in our unions, and there is no room for Zionism in our unions\".\n\nThe university's barrister Robert Dick SC, who is not acting for Riemer and Keane, accepted the university could be found vicariously liable.\n\nBut Dick submitted an interlocutory application that the case against the university should be struck out because the posts did not \"disparage\" Jewish people and was referring to Zionism as a political concept.\n\nTaylor put forward another interlocutory application on Tuesday to strike out some of the pleadings in Toltz's claims ahead of the trial against Riemer.\n\nThis included claims that public statements by Riemer can be relied upon \"cumulatively or collectively for the purposes of establishing both the causation and racial elements in s18C of the RDA\".\n\nTaylor argued this should be struck out because it could skew the impact of the posts, and result in the whole being considered \"greater than the sum of its parts\".\n\nButt argued in response it is a \"straight forward and appropriate pleading\".\n\nProf Suzanne Rutland, Ariel Eisner, and Yaniv Levy have also joined Toltz's application against the two academics.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.0534559796113923,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Jessie Taylor\",\n

He used the moment to underline Australia's support for Donald Trump's peace plan to end the conflict, for which negotiations are under way in Egypt.\n\nIn Israel, unofficial commemorations will be held in the small kibbutzim of southern Israel whose members were killed or kidnapped, and a large rally will be held in Tel Aviv to call for the release of the remaining hostages from Hamas captivity in Gaza. The official national ceremony of remembrance will be held on 16 October.\n\nWhat happens when AI doesn't do what it's supposed to?

The cost is going up dramatically and the evidence suggests that most who come off the jabs put weight back on rapidly.\n\nIt leaves people such as the career coach Aimee Young facing a dilemma. As she explained in a recent Instagram video, she was being forced to give up the jabs she had been taking since the start of the year.

Sidoti is one of Australia's most experienced international legal experts and a member of the UN independent international commission of inquiry, which issued a report last month stating that the Israeli government and military were committing genocide in Gaza. Israel has rejected the report's findings.\n\nHanna was asked outside the supreme court if it was beyond the appeal court's jurisdiction to make such a finding. He said it wasn't, given the court needed to weigh up \"the seriousness and urgency of the cause\" when determining if NSW police were justified in seeking to prohibit the protest.\n\n\"Genocide is the crime of crimes, and that's what Israel's committing, and that's why we say it's relevant,\" he said.\n\nJustice Desmond Fagan, during a directions hearing on Friday, referred in court to Israel's conduct as genocide.\n\nAt one point, he said he thought the crowd could exceed 100,000 because of \"what appears to be the sentiment in the community, and that has developed over two years of sort of real-time broadcasting of genocide of too many people\".\n\nFagan urged police to consider the \"strengths of feelings\" on the issue within the community.\n\nThe assistant commissioner Peter McKenna announced on Friday that NSW police were knocking back the Palestine Action Group's \"form one\" application to hold an authorised protest due to safety concerns, including the potential for a crowd crush.\n\nPolice said they were open to negotiating an alternative route and \"understand that this is a significant anniversary\", two years on from 7 October and the start of the Israel-Gaza war.\n\nA form one, if accepted by police, protects those attending a protest from being charged for certain actions - such as obstructing traffic - under the Summary Offences Act.\n\nWhen police reject an application, the court has the final say over whether a protest should be \"authorised\" and attendees afforded legal protections.\n\nThe court heard on Tuesday that one of the legal complexities to be dealt with by the court of appeal was whether authorising the protest would conflict with legislation governing the use of the Opera House, which restricts protests.\n\nThe Executive Council of Australian Jewry (ECAJ) and the Jewish Board of Deputies were planning to challenge Sunday's protest and its location.\n\nA lawyer appearing before the court on behalf of the groups on Tuesday said some members of the Jewish community were fearful because of what unfolded at the Opera House on 9 October 2023.\n\nProtesters marched from Sydney's Town Hall to the Opera House two years ago when the sails were lit in blue and white to commemorate the victims of the Hamas attacks on Israel that killed about 1,200 people.\n\nA group of people - who police later confirmed were not part of the Palestine Action Group and said weren't at the initial Town Hall rally - lit flares and yelled antisemitic chants, including \"Fuck the Jews\".\n\nThe court was yet to decide whether the Jewish group's application would be heard.\n\nThe ECAJ co-chief executive, Alex Ryvchin, said on Tuesday that Sunday's planned rally would \"incite yet more hatred against our community\".\n\n\"They will do so once again at a national landmark, at great public expense, and they will shred what little harmony remains in this society,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"And the cost of all this will be borne by all of us in the form of higher security and social cohesion programs to undo some of the harm we are allowing them to inflict. This madness has to stop.\"\n\nJust over two months ago, the Palestine Action Group went to the supreme court in their bid to march over the Sydney Harbour Bridge.

First up on the stage to be greeted by Trump was Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed, the vice-president of the United Arab Emirates. A beaming Trump pointed out Mansour's \"lovely shoes\", then pointed at him, saying: \"A lot of cash, bundles of cash.\" The Manchester City owner attempted to beam back happily at this self-evident truth.\n\nAnother to find favour with the Sun King was Giorgia Meloni, the only woman gatecrashing an otherwise male-only event. Trump turned to the Italian prime minister, saying: \"In the United States, it would be the end of your political career. But I'll take the risk. Do you mind if I say you're beautiful? Because you truly are beautiful.\"\n\nThe unqualified compliment stood in contrast to Meloni's earlier interaction with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who also told her she looked \"great\", before adding: \"But you should not smoke so much.\"\n\nTrump had a lot of praise for the Turkish leader, since he was a \"tough\" guy. The short Trump biography of Erdoğan gave the impression that we were in the presence of a blend of Genghis Khan and Greta Garbo. \"Erdoğan possesses one of the strongest armies in the world,\" Trump opined. \"It is much stronger than it appears. He has triumphed in many conflicts, but he does not want any praise. He wants to be left alone.\n\n\"He is a tough person, but he is my friend, and he is always there when I need him. When Nato faces problems with him, they call me. I speak with Erdoğan, and he never lets me down.\"\n\nAnother tough guy to receive Trump's seal of approval was the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi - nominally his co-host. Sitting down alongside Sisi, oblivious to his outstretched hand, Trump delivered his verdict on a man whose government stands accused of wholesale repression. \"I am here with my friend, a strong leader, the president ... and also a general, and he is good at both,\" Trump said. \"They have a low crime rate here, unlike the United States, where we have a high crime rate because we have state governors who don't know what they're doing ... but here in Egypt, they don't mess around when it comes to crime.\"\n\nThe Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who had made the guestlist for no ostensible reason save his detestation of the EU, was also blessed. Trump said he liked Viktor, rolling the \"r\" to effect and adding: \"I know a lot of people don't agree with me, but I am the only one that matters.\" Trump's fellow world leaders behind him, including Keir Starmer, looked a little upset at another self-evident truth.\n\nLess fortunate was the Iraqi prime minister, Mohammed Shia' al-Sudani. Trump described his country as one \"with so much oil it does not know what to do with it. That is a big problem if you have so much oil you don't kow what to do with it\". And with this aperçu, Sudani was dispatched.\n\nSuddenly it was Starmer's moment to shine. Trump asked: where is the UK representative? Starmer raised his hand, adding: \"Right behind you as usual\", before being asked to step forward to the rostrum. Expecting to say a few words, he was instead thanked for turning up at short notice and directed by Trump to return to the UK's natural place, in the dark shadow behind the Great Man.\n\nAnother European leader to suffer was Emmanuel Macron. Aware of the French president's ability to appear in summit photography, Trump was taken aback when he discovered Macron had chosen to sit facing him in the audience rather than joining him on the stage. \"I can't believe it, you're taking a low-key approach today,\" Trump said. \"I imagined you standing behind me.\"\n\nThe Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, deigned to approach Trump to point out that in his remarks about Canada, Trump had promoted Carney to the post of president. \"You are fortunate I did not call you governor,\" Trump shot back.\n\nThe one man who seemed to know how to handle the host was Pakistani prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif. Sharif showered Trump with so much praise that Trump stepped forward to try to read the text of his speech, only to be pushed back forcibly by Sharif as he continued his paean.\n\n\"India and Pakistan are nuclear powers, and had it not been for his and his wonderful team's intervention during those critical four days, a devastating war might have erupted,\" Sharif said. \"Who would have survived to tell the tale? History has immortalized his name in golden letters. May God bless you and grant you a long life to continue serving your country and nation with this great spirit.\" And so on.\n\nOne leader who may have been breathing a sigh of relief is the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, who sought to protect his dignity by turning down the invitation altogether.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.5341680044862772,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Donald Trump\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Government of the United States\",\n    \"role\": \"President\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"A lot of cash, bundles of cash.\",\n    \"message\": \"Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed possesses a substantial amount of wealth.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Donald Trump\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Government of the United States\",\n    \"role\": \"President\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"In the United States, it would be the end of your political career.

It was the first such meeting since Donald Trump announced Blair's role in his 20-point plan.\n\nAlthough Blair was present in New York for key meetings with Arab leaders at the UN general assembly, this is the first attempt to test the water about his possible role with the Palestinian leadership. Hamas, which has said it will not have a future role in the government of Gaza, has opposed Blair's involvement and the idea that any board should act as foreign guardian for Palestine.\n\nThe precise powers of the US president's proposed \"board of peace\" and its relationship to a technocratic committee of appointed Palestinians has yet to be clarified.\n\nIn a statement, al-Sheikh said: \"Today, I met Mr Tony Blair to discuss the day after the war and making President Trump's efforts, which aim at stopping the war and establishing lasting peace in the region, a success. We have confirmed our readiness to work with President Trump, Mr Blair and the partners to consolidate the ceasefire, the entry of aid, the release of hostages and prisoners, and then start with the recovery and reconstruction.\"\n\nHe continued: \"We stressed the importance of stopping the undermining of the PA, and especially the return of withheld Palestinian revenues, and preventing the undermining of the two-state solution in preparation for a comprehensive and lasting peace in accordance with international legitimacy.\"\n\nThe PA is keen that tax revenues withheld by the Israeli government are released, since this is preventing salary payments and undermining its liquidity, in violation of the Oslo accords.\n\nIsrael has also threatened not to renew next month the annual waiver of terrorist financing laws, which allows Israeli banks to process transactions with Palestinian banks.\n\nSharhabeel al-Zaeem, the PA's justice minister, last week criticised Blair's involvement, saying: \"Is this the independent Palestinian state we are aiming for? All these struggles for all these years in order to have Mr Blair, who failed in London, who failed in Britain, who failed in Iraq, come and - with all due respect at a personal level to Mr Blair - be our guardian as if we were minors?\"\n\nBlair will have to negotiate a fine line since neither the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, nor the Trump administration have yet said they are willing to work with the PA. Trump banned the PA president, Mahmoud Abbas, from flying to the UN, although reports on Sunday suggested Abbas would attend Monday's summit in Egypt.\n\nThe Trump plan did not specify when power would be transferred to a reformed PA, but at a minimum the PA would have to hold elections and show it was capable of overseeing the vast reconstruction effort. Blair has reassured the PA that its involvement is a sign Gaza and the West Bank will eventually be governed as one entity.\n\nFrench diplomats said they were also starting to work on a possible UN security council mandate for the planned international stabilisation force\n\nTrump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, with whom Blair has a close relationship, has frequently insulted Abbas, describing him as a leader of refugee group.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.5156603896827029,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Hussein al-Sheikh\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Palestinian Authority\",\n    \"role\": \"deputy president of the Palestinian Authority and head of the Palestine Liberation Organisation executive committee\",\n    \"nationality\": \"PLE\",\n    \"quote\": \"Today, I met Mr Tony Blair to discuss the day after the war and making President Trump's efforts, which aim at stopping the war and establishing lasting peace in the region, a success.

The prime minister thanked President Trump for his invitation but stated that he would not be able to attend due to the proximity of the event to the start of the holiday.\"\n\nFigures on the extreme right in Netanyahu's coalition government had also threatened to resign if he went to the conference.\n\nInternational criminal court arrest warrants have been issued against Netanyahu for alleged war crimes in Gaza, and while Egypt is not a signatory to the court, his presence at the summit would have been contentious, including among those Arab states that have not normalised relations with Israel. More than 20 world leaders were due to attend the hastily arranged summit.\n\nThe row about Netanyahu's presence shows how hard it will be for some Muslim countries to normalise relations with Israel in the way Trump wants.\n\nPictures of Erdoğan negotiating with Netanyahu or shaking hands with the Israeli leader would have been disastrous for the Turkish leader domestically, and would have also led to questions about Ankara's planned role in the international stabilisation force that is due to look after security in Gaza. Erdoğan has repeatedly called Israel's actions in Gaza a genocide.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.769993793533509,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Benjamin Netanyahu\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Israeli Prime Minister's Office\",\n    \"role\": \"Prime Minister of Israel\",\n    \"nationality\": \"ISR\",\n    \"quote\": \"Prime Minister Netanyahu was invited by US President Trump to participate in a conference taking place today in Egypt.

Stalls sold keffiyehs and people handed out placards that read \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free\", \"it's not a crime to act against genocide\" and \"Starmer has blood on his hands, free Palestine\".\n\nBen Jamal, the director of the campaign group, said the march went ahead, despite a ceasefire coming into effect, because the \"plan that has been laid out by Donald Trump is not a plan for enduring peace\".\n\nHe said the plan said \"nothing about the root causes of violence\" nor anything \"about the system of apartheid\" in Palestine or the \"right to self-determination\" for Palestinians. He added that the group's campaigning and protesting will not end \"until the Palestinian people are finally free\".\n\nThis is the 32nd national demonstration in support of Palestine since October 2023, according to PSC , where protesters will march along Embankment before a rally in Whitehall.\n\nA counter-protest by Stop the Hate was expected to take place at the junction of Aldwych and the Strand, with police putting measures in place to try to prevent a clash between the two groups.\n\nScotland Yard said it had imposed conditions on both demonstrations under the Public Order Act to \"prevent serious disruption\" and had set out specific areas where protesters could gather as well as a march route.\n\nLast weekend, the government announced that police would be given greater powers to restrict protests by allowing them to consider the \"cumulative impact\" of repeated demonstrations.\n\nThe home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, called for pro-Palestine protests scheduled to take place last weekend to be cancelled or postponed after a terrorist attack on a synagogue in Manchester where two people were killed by an attacker.\n\nOn Wednesday, while on a trade mission in India, Keir Starmer said protest laws, including chants, are being reviewed by the government\n\n\"I've asked the home secretary to look more broadly at what other powers are available, how they're being used, and whether they should be changed in any way,\" he told reporters. \"I think we need to go further than that in relation to some of the chants that are going on at some of these protests.\"\n\nIt is just over two years since the start of the war in Gaza.

She said her request for more medication was not being met while she was being held in a prison environment she described as \"dystopian\".\n\nMcEwen and Lamont are among seven Australians confirmed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Dfat) to have been detained in Israel. Dfat said on Monday it was providing consular assistance to the Australians including through in-person visits.\n\nThey are being held in a high-security prison in the Negev desert after being arrested as part of the pro-Palestinian flotilla carrying aid to Gaza, and allege that they and fellow inmates were offered water that was undrinkable due to a strong chemical taste.\n\nMcEwen told Australian officials he had been held in a cage with 80 other people without food or water while the Israeli national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir yelled abuse at them, while Lamont told officials that when she arrived at Ketziot prison she was taken to a room with other women, where Ben-Gvir berated them and called them \"terrorists\".\n\nMcEwen, a 40-year-old care worker and Lamont, a 54-year-old documentary film-maker - both from the New South Wales northern rivers - were arrested on Thursday when their Gaza-bound ships were intercepted by the Israeli navy. They were part of the Global Sumud Flotilla of 42 vessels carrying more than 450 people, among them parliamentarians, lawyers and activists - including the Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg - all of whom were arrested.\n\nDfat officials visited the detained Australians on Friday. McEwen told them of \"degrading and humiliating treatment\" after he was taken to the port of Ashdod, according to a report seen by Guardian Australia.\n\n\"He said his morale was low due to the degrading and humiliating treatment he had been enduring from Israeli prison guards and soldiers, including sleep deprivation techniques and physical intimidation,\" the Dfat report read.\n\nHis mother, Jacinta McEwen, a former nurse, said she had been calling Dfat for daily updates and was concerned by the \"full-on\" conditions under which her son was being held.\n\n\"If he's got a dislocated shoulder and he's had a head injury and he hasn't received any medical aid, I'm worried about that,\" she said.\n\nMcEwen said she believed her son's deportation was being held up by his refusal to sign a form that would acknowledge that he had entered Israel illegally - the flotilla maintains it was illegally intercepted by the Israeli navy in international waters.\n\nMcEwen told Dfat officials that Israeli soldiers had torn up pages of his passport in front of him because his passport was microchipped. Both McEwen and Lamont threw their phones into the sea before their capture.\n\nWhile McEwen said his arrest on board the Mia Mia had been executed with minimal force, Lamont - travelling on a different ship - said she had \"humiliating\" experience.\n\nLamont claimed her hands were zip-tied behind her back, she was sprayed with a water cannon and was left to sit in an unventilated area with her hands tied and clothes soaked for seven hours - a time during which she said her head was repeatedly shoved down by Israeli forces.\n\nBoth are being held in the Ketziot prison used primarily to detain Palestinian prisoners, many of whom Israel accuses of involvement in militant or terrorist activities.\n\nAfter Australian officials visited Lamont they noted she was \"emotionally distressed\", saying in a separate report that she had \"cried multiple times during the visit\". The mother of two was reported feeling dehydrated, weak, dizzy and confused.\n\nLamont said a guard had warned her the water from taps was unsafe to drink and that she believed her dehydration was exacerbating her high blood pressure.\n\nOn the day of her arrest, after her daily medication was confiscated, Lamont said a doctor - after checking her blood pressure - had given her one dose of medication. But after Australian officials visited her they reported she was feeling weak, confused and lethargic and worried she was at risk of stroke. Her request to see a doctor again had received no response.\n\nA Global Movement to Gaza Australia spokesperson, Talitha Mitchell, said she feared her friend was at risk of dying without access to medication.\n\nJulie Webb-Pullman, the mother of another detained Australian, the Melbourne-based GP Bianca Webb-Pullman said she had received a call from Australian officials on Saturday giving her a verbal account of their visit to Ketziot prison.\n\nWebb-Pullman said her daughter had reported that she had been subjected to abuse, humiliation, intimidation and was man-handled and shoved and left in a courtyard in the sun for five hours with no shade, food or water.\n\nShe also described a tap with contaminated water, meaning she had drunk no or little water in days.\n\nDfat responded to questions with a statement that said the Australian government had \"made clear to Israel our expectation that detainees will receive humane treatment in line with international norms\".\n\n\"We repeat our call on Israel to enable the sustained, unimpeded flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza,\" the statement said.\n\nThe Guardian contacted Israel's prison service, the Israel Defense Forces, the Israel's ministry for foreign affairs and the Israeli embassy in Australia but none have responded to a request for

It says the narrative stigmatised \"support for Palestine and Palestinian resistance movements\" and \"worked to discriminate against Muslims and other racialised groups in the UK\".\n\nA change to a Labour government in July 2024 did \"little to change official government narratives\", according to the report, which says it continued to associate critique of Israel and support for Palestine with \"violent antisemitism\" and \"targeted Muslim and racialised groups\".\n\nRecent government figures have shown hate crimes against Muslims are up by nearly a fifth, after figures earlier this year revealed Islamophobic assaults in the UK surged by 73% in 2024. Antisemitic incidents in the UK have also increased, leading to a decrease in feelings of safety in the community, concerns of which were echoed by community members at a 7 October memorial event in London. Two Jewish worshipers were killed at a Manchester synagogue earlier this month, in what authorities said was an Islamist-inspired terrorist attack.\n\nAs outrage at Israel's war in Gaza continues to draw thousands of people to UK streets, the Labour government has met concerns of rising antisemitism and specific inflammatory chants at pro-Palestinian marches with the proscription of Palestine Action and proposed increase in police powers at protests. The government recently condemned the rise in anti-Muslim hate crimes. However, community leaders have criticised a lack of response.\n\nLast week, Keir Starmer's plea for the cancellation of \"un-British\" demonstrations on the second anniversary of the 7 October attack was criticised by demonstration organisers as the conflation of the actions of Israel with Jewish people around the world. Civil liberties groups have also expressed concern over potential restrictions over the right to protest.\n\nWhile across the UK, US, France and Germany, laws around protest vary, with cultural contexts reflected in the legislation, the report says the violations within the four countries are also \"representative of much broader trends\" in the repression of Palestinian solidarity globally.\n\nIn the US, similar action in solidarity with Palestine has been met with arrests, legal action and mounting threats. In France, the government has been criticised for repressing those expressing solidarity with Palestinians, including banning demonstrations in certain cities as well as the decision to dissolve the pro-Palestinian human rights and solidarity collective Urgence Palestine.\n\nAnd in Germany, where pro-Palestinian rallies have drawn thousands to the streets, under the shadow of the country's postwar identity indelibly shaped by the Nazi regime's responsibility for the Holocaust, tactics by police have been criticised as excessive and many have disputed the decision to ban certain slogans under the law as antisemitic.\n\nThe report recommends the UK establish an independent body to oversee policing practices during demonstrations, and reform section 12 of the Terrorism Act 2000 to exclude protected political opinions and solidarity slogans. It also recommends the repeal of section 11 of the Public Order Act 2023, which allows for suspicionless stop and searches during demonstrations.\n\n\"Ultimately, the crackdown on solidarity with Palestinians reveals a profound crisis, not only of human rights in the occupied territories but of freedom itself, in societies that claim to be democratic,\" the report says.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.556573915721184,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Yosra Frawes\",\n    \"organisation\": \"International Federation for Human Rights\",\n    \"role\": \"Head of the Maghreb and Middle East desk\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"This trend reflects a worrying shift towards the normalisation of exceptional measures in dealing with dissenting voices.\",\n    \"message\": \"A concerning trend is emerging where extraordinary actions are becoming normal when dealing with opposing viewpoints.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"International Federation for Human Rights\",\n    \"organisation\": \"International Federation for Human Rights\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"The right to protest has come under sustained attack from the British government across administrations and party lines.\",\n    \"message\": \"The fundamental right to protest has been consistently targeted by the British government, irrespective of the political party in power.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Suella Braverman\",\n    \"organisation\": \"UK Government\",\n    \"role\": \"Former Home Secretary\",\n    \"nationality\": \"GBR\",\n    \"quote\": \"hate marches\",\n    \"message\": \"Pro-Palestinian demonstrations are characterized as hateful.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"International Federation for Human Rights\",\n    \"organisation\": \"International Federation for Human Rights\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"Ultimately, the crackdown on solidarity with Palestinians reveals a profound crisis, not only of human rights in the occupied territories but of freedom itself, in societies that claim to be democratic.\",\n    \"message\": \"The suppression of support for Palestinians indicates a deep crisis, not only for human rights in the occupied territories but also for the very concept of freedom in self-proclaimed democratic societies.\"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP"}],"createTime":"2025-10-15T10:37:21.668803Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"YXnvaIPpKNKfnvgP3J7q2QM","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":398,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":398}],"promptTokenCount":1418,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1418}],"thoughtsTokenCount":2243,"totalTokenCount":4059,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}}}

As soon as they saw the Palestinian prisoners through the windows of the bus, hundreds of people gathering in front of a theatre in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank rushed forward, chanting the names of loved ones they had not seen for years and in some cases, decades.\n\nThe prisoners were gaunt, the sharp angles of their faces decorated by freshly scabbed-over wounds. Loved ones hoisted them up on their shoulders with ease. One prisoner, swaddled in a Palestinian keffiyeh and splaying his fingers into a V for victory, was dropped before his mother, whose feet he began to kiss.\n\nIn total, 88 Palestinians were released from Israeli prisons and sent to the occupied West Bank on Monday - the other nearly 2,000, a number that includes about 1,700 Palestinians seized from Gaza during the war and held without charge, were sent back to Gaza, where a minority would travel on to neighbouring countries.\n\nThe detainees and prisoners were released by Israel a few hours after all living Israeli hostages were returned from Gaza. The exchange marked the first step in a ceasefire that could permanently end the two-year conflict in the territory.\n\nThe geopolitical implication of the release was far from families' minds in Ramallah on Monday; most were celebrating a release they never thought would come. Most of the men were serving life sentences and many were charged with violent crimes.\n\n\"He's been locked up for 24 years,\" said a relative of Saber Masalma, a member of Fatah, the main faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) who was arrested in 2002 and sentenced to life in prison on charges of conspiracy to cause death and placing explosive charges.\n\nHe shoved a phone in Masalma's face, eager to introduce him to his adult niece over a video call, while he juggled requests for selfies with his relatives.\n\nHe had not seen Masalma for two years, as Israel had cut off family visits to detainees after the 7 October attack by Hamas-led militants who killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostage. Masalma had warned him over the phone that he might not recognise him owing to the amount of weight he had lost in prison.\n\n\"He looks like a dead body. But we will bring him back to life,\" he said, laughing. They were off to a restaurant, where they would have to be careful that Saber did not eat too much, as his stomach was not used to much food after not eating well in prison.\n\nThe other prisoners also looked to be in bad shape. Their cheekbones jutted out, with some bearing the marks of recent beatings and a few unable to walk without being propped up by their relatives.\n\nWhen asked about their treatment in the prisons, a detainee apologised to the Guardian and said he could not answer, for fear that he would face repercussions from Israeli authorities, only saying that it was \"horrible\".\n\nAnother prisoner said that the conditions were \"very, very, very difficult,\" and that the last two years in prison were the \"worst two years of his life\", asking that he not be named.\n\nPrior to Monday's release, 11,056 Palestinians were held in Israeli prisons, according to statistics from the Israeli NGO HaMoked in October 2025. At least 3,500 of those were held in administrative detention without trial.\n\nPalestinians have faced abuse and inhumane treatment in Israeli prisons \"as a matter of policy\" according to the Israeli human rights organisation B'Tselem. The group alleges that Palestinian prisoners are denied medical treatment, adequate food and face physical abuse in Israeli prisons.\n\nActivists have long said that wide-scale imprisonment of Palestinians is used as a tool to enforce Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories, with statistics estimating up to 40% of Palestinians have been arrested at some point.\n\nIsrael says that its prison system complies with international law.\n\nIsrael also forbadepeople from celebrating the prisoners' release on Monday, firing teargas at family members and journalists waiting near Ofer prison, in the occupied West Bank, where detainees were kept. A flyer distributed by the Israeli military warned people that \"we are surveilling you everywhere\" and threatening that if they supported \"terrorist organisations\" they could be arrested.\n\nThe Guardian spoke with six different relatives of prisoners who said they were visited by Israeli security services in recent days.\n\n\"They came to warn us not to hold celebrations, not to raise flags or banners, not to gather in the diwan [hall]. These days, the hardest thing is to speak the truth,\" said a relative of the prisoner Hani al-Zeer, who asked not to be identified by name out of fear of security repercussions. Al-Zeer had been imprisoned for 23 years, and the relative, as well as al-Zeer's son, had also been imprisoned several times.\n\nAmid the scenes of joy, there was also sorrow. Several families who had been told by the Israeli security services that their family members would be returning home were surprised to see that they were not on the buses on Monday.\n\nTwo different prisoner lists were circulating on Monday morning in the hours before prisoners were released. On one list, some prisoners were slated to be released back home, on the other, prisoners were to be deported to Gaza.\n\nTo Um Abed, whose brother had been scheduled for release, the sudden possibility that her brother, Kamal Imran, could be deported to Gaza, came as a shock. If he was deported to Gaza, there was virtually no way for her to see him unless he was able to leave the territory.\n\n\"We've been waiting here for his release for two days. We're shocked to hear this. The Israelis stormed our house and told us we were forbidden from doing any kind of celebration - so he should be released,\" said Um Abed, tears in her eyes.\n\nShe waited anxiously as the buses arrived to the drop-off point in Ramallah, waiting for her brother to emerge. When the last man got off the buses with no sign of her brother, she clutched her cheeks and wailed.\n\nOthers evidently had been told their loved ones were to be returned home, only to find out at the last minute that they were being deported. \"Why are they deporting him?\" a woman screamed in tears, as police officers rushed her away from the crowd.\n\n\"It would have been easier if they just told us from the beginning. We don't know where he is. Egypt? Gaza? We are devastated,\" said Raed Imran, as he led Abed to the car where she had been preparing to receive her brother.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.2702516828264509,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"a relative of Saber Masalma\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"He's been locked up for 24 years.\",\n    \"message\": \"Saber Masalma has been imprisoned for 24 years.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"a relative of Saber Masalma\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"He looks like a dead body.

During a routine operation last week, five corpses were recovered. Not much was left of the poor souls whose dream ended in the heat: just skeletons and skulls, held together by fragments of clothes. Wearing masks and gloves, volunteers from the Red Crescent did what they could to recover the bodies with dignity, slipping them into black bags for proper burial.\n\nIt is a wretched job but one the authorities are growing used to: as many as one in four migrants who try to cross the desert perish. They pay people traffickers for seats on pick-up trucks, but like the Channel boats, the vehicles are often unfit for purpose and dangerously overloaded. When they get stuck in the sand, passengers are forced to walk.\n\nWhat the Libyan National Army says it really needs to manage a crisis that spans thousands of square kilometres is helicopters and drones, but they can't have them, because of UN sanctions.\n\nThe long running ban on imports of anything that might have military use is a legacy of the chaos that engulfed Libya after the fall of Colonel Muammar Gadaffi in 2011. At the time, David Cameron, who led an international campaign of air and missile strikes against the dictator's forces, believed he had helped free the country from a dictator. On the streets of Benghazi, grateful crowds greeted our then prime minister as a hero. He promised to stand by them as they rebuilt their country. Instead, Libya descended into violent chaos and he and the rest of the international community ran for cover.\n\nToday, western Libya remains a dangerous mess of warring militias, drug dealers and illegal weapons. Ironically, this is where the internationally recognised \"Government of National Unity\" is based. The name could not be more misplaced, for the authority barely controls Tripoli, never mind anywhere else.\n\nBased in the most unstable part of the country, the administration is a temporary and seemingly ineffectual fix, pending national elections that never seem to come.\n\nBy contrast, peace seems to have returned to the east, where Benghazi is booming. Today the city centre is a relaxed scene of seafood restaurants; coffee shops plying freshly baked croissants flavoured with honey and almonds and outdoor cafes in leafy courtyards.\n\nRoads better than Britain's\n\nNew shopping precincts gleam with upscale boutiques selling sports and fashion wear. Some big brands - I spotted Adidas, Mamuso and Omega - are here already; others are coming.\n\nTraffic is bad, but the roads are noticeably better than ours.\n\nIt could be Tunis, or old Dubai, not least because UAE state developer EMAAR seems to be everywhere. Apparently a deal has been struck with the Emiratis to develop some 10km of the coastline. Construction is under way on luxury hotels, sleek residential and commercial towers - even a golf course. Meanwhile, city planners are creating parks and lakes and building seven new bridges. In short, a city with a deeply troubled past is powering into a new era.\n\nSuch is the sense of renewal that it is hard to imagine that Islamic State once ran amok. Locals are still haunted by the horrors they inflicted: severed heads hung from bridges; families forced to flee for their lives as RPGs pulverised residential neighbourhoods.\n\nIt was here that US ambassador Christopher Stevens tragically lost his life along with two CIA contractors when Islamic extremists attacked the American embassy in 2012. A small section of the old city still looks like Gaza or Homs: bombed-out apartment blocks keeling sideways over piles of rubble. Flights of stairs left exposed when external walls were blown off dangle precariously from hollowed-out buildings.\n\nThere is talk of preserving a little bit of this as a monument to terrible times, but Benghazi has very decidedly moved on. Officially, eastern Libya, which has the vast majority of the country's oil and gas, is still controlled by the same general, Khalifa Haftar, whose forces drove out the jihadists five years ago, but power is now passing to his sons.

One speaker may have several quotes.\n\nInclude direct quotes only, do not include paraphrased quotes.\n\nHere is the article:\n\n\n<article>The hosts in Oslo are closing in on qualification but the politics surrounding their visitors' presence casts a shadow over the football\n\nIt will be the most high-security sports event in Norway since the Winter Olympics in 1994. Anti-terror measures are in place throughout Oslo; a no-fly zone will be implemented in the skies above Ullevi Stadion and through all the tension it could be easy to forget that the national team are within touching distance of a first World Cup appearance for 27 years. Beating Israel would put them on the verge but the visitors' presence has added multiple layers of complexity and controversy.\n\nThat will be clear on Saturday afternoon, when a crowd of several thousand is expected to march peacefully from the centre of Oslo to a stage set up near the ground. It has been organised by the Palestine Committee in Norway under the slogan \"Red card for Israel\" and other bodies will be holding their own protests too. Outside Grønland metro station, posters of unclear provenance advertised a separate demonstration under the name \"Stop the national match\". The authorities have been preparing for this occasion since the teams were drawn together more than a year ago.\n\nIsrael are used to this: they are more than accustomed to the heightened environment around their matches and the enhanced level of security. \"Not much higher than usual,\" said their captain, Eli Dasa, which in practice is understood to mean 16 Mossad agents will be present. Nonetheless the added edge around this particular fixture has been inescapable.\n\nIt was evident in the grilling, much of it hostile, dished out by Israeli journalists to the Norwegian Football Federation president, Lise Klaveness, on Friday afternoon. The NFF's stance that Israel should be banned from international football, repeated publicly by Klaveness, has been made more stridently than that of any other European nation and it is one reason for a souring of relations. A decision to donate the proceeds from Saturday's game to Doctors Without Borders' work in Gaza also drew an affronted response from the Israeli Football Association, which felt a point was being made.\n\nUefa was close to voting on a ban for Israel, which would not have applied to Fifa-run World Cup qualifiers without the global governing body following suit, after the United Nations concluded damningly that the state has committed genocide in Gaza. That idea was put on hold as Donald Trump's peace plan gathered momentum last week. Klaveness repeated several times that she had not been the primary driving force behind those moves and reiterated, too, that the illegal presence of Israeli teams in occupied Palestinian territory is the reason for her position.\n\n\"It's not an effort to ban Israel [in particular], it's about a rules-based system,\" she said. \"Like all people, we're very happy there is a peace agreement. It's more important than the game that the bombs stop and the hostages go home. When we've talked about sanctions it's about breaches of Fifa law. That should be a continued discussion.\"\n\nThe NFF has never considered taking matters into their own hands and refusing to play Israel but campaigners such as Line Khateeb, who leads the Palestine Committee in Norway, believe this game should not be taking place. \"Not at all,\" she says. \"Israel shouldn't be included in an international football arena when they are violating international law and preventing Palestinian football players from playing. As long as Israel's occupation withstands, Palestinians don't have a chance to play football, to live, to learn or move freely.\n\n\"We won't disturb the game, we want Norway to win. We will protest, but after this game there will be other games involving youth teams or in European competitions. They should reject receiving Israel for Norwegian football teams.\"\n\nThe tension between taking a political or moral stance and cheering Norway towards a historic achievement has been further highlighted by the decision of Norsk Supporterallianse, a vocal presence on the domestic scene, to step back from any involvement in protests or statements around the Israel game.\n\nAn Israel side that entertain going forward but repeatedly leak goals must win to retain any realistic chance of qualifying. There was an extraordinary scene in their pre-match press conference when their manager, Ran Ben Shimon, requested a pause and donned a kippah before reciting the bible passage Jeremiah 31:16. It was in tribute to the agreement that Hamas's 20 living Israeli hostages must be released by 10am BST on Monday. Long-serving observers of the national team said it was the first time an Israel manager had made such a public intervention.\n\nThis week's events will be used as motivation. \"It's a lot of excitement, it helps us a lot,\" said Dasa. \"Since 7 October 2023 we haven't attended a game with the feeling of hope that something will happen, but now they are on their way home and we would like to give them a nice present.\"\n\nA small group of protesters was stationed outside Ullevi while the Israel team trained on Friday night. Fewer than 200 Israel fans will be present to see the match. Norwegian supporters will be 3,000 fewer in number than normal, with small sections of the 28,000 capacity closed to prevent possible pitch incursions. That will be just one visual reminder, while proceedings unfold on the turf, of the context off it.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.34787277758820895,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Eli Dasa\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Israeli National Football Team\",\n    \"role\": \"Captain\",\n    \"nationality\": \"ISR\",\n    \"quote\": \"Not much higher than usual\",\n    \"message\": \"The level of security around the matches is not significantly elevated compared to typical arrangements.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Lise Klaveness\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Norwegian Football Federation\",\n    \"role\": \"President\",\n    \"nationality\": \"NOR\",\n    \"quote\": \"It's not an effort to ban Israel [in particular], it's about a rules-based system.

No, there's no punchline - it's not that kind of anecdote. \"My life has changed for ever,\" Yousafzai says sadly, as we gaze at the semi-derelict structure. \"Everything changed for ever, after that [night].\"\n\nThe shed is tucked away at the back of Lady Margaret Hall, away from the prying eyes of Oxford's college life. You have to know how to find it. Yousafzai leads me through quadrangles and out into a hidden garden. Inside are dusty pint glasses and spiderwebs, and board games with the pieces missing.\n\nWe are meeting on a bright summer afternoon, ahead of the release of her memoir, Finding My Way, a sequel to her 2013 bestseller I Am Malala. Dressed in a blue shirt, jeans and a headscarf, Yousafzai is accompanied, at a discreet distance, by two close-protection officers. The college is quiet - it's the summer holidays - and Yousafzai attracts no attention from the few students who remain as she tramps across the grass.\n\nThis is not our first interview. Our last conversation sparked days of negative headlines for Yousafzai, back home in her native Pakistan. As we gaze at the bong-shed, I fear that round two may lead to more of the same.\n\nIn 2021, I profiled a then-23-year-old Yousafzai for the cover of British Vogue. The world's youngest Nobel laureate - she received the award at 17, for her activism for girls' education - had recently graduated from university and was about to launch her adult life.\n\nYousafzai began campaigning at the age of 11. Her father, Ziauddin, is an education activist and she followed in his footsteps, writing a blog for BBC Urdu about her life as the Taliban shut down girls' schools across Pakistan's Swat valley where she lived. When a Taliban gunman shot her in the head on her school bus when she was just 15 years old, Yousafzai was airlifted to the UK and made a remarkable recovery, resettling with her family in Birmingham, where she attended secondary school, all the while campaigning for the rights of girls around the world to receive an education.\n\nWhen I met Yousafzai in April 2021, she had just got a 2.1 from Oxford in politics, philosophy and economics, and signed a deal with Apple TV+ to develop and produce her own slate of TV and films. (The deal has now ended.) We did an interview at a hotel in London before walking around a Covid-era St James's Park. When I asked her if she had a romantic partner, she blanched. \"I would say that I have come across people who have been great, and I hope that I do find someone,\" she stuttered, visibly embarrassed.\n\nLater, she mused on marriage. \"I still don't understand why people have to get married,\" she told me. \"If you want to have a person in your life, why do you have to sign marriage papers, why can't it just be a partnership?\"\n\nHer comments seemed unexceptional. I was more concerned that the fact she'd told me that she frequented pubs could create controversy, given that Yousafzai is Muslim, and so when I wrote up the interview I was careful to specify that she did not drink alcohol.\n\nThe article came out. Yousafzai shared it, and sent me a message of thanks. The following day, logging on to Twitter (now X), I saw that #shameonMalala was trending in Pakistan. Her comments had been widely misinterpreted to mean that she was denouncing nikah, the Islamic institution of marriage, and implicitly to suggest that she condoned premarital sex.\n\nShe led Pakistan's national news for days. Online commentators accused Yousafzai of betraying her religion as a result of western indoctrination. An influential cleric tagged her father on Twitter, asking him to explain his daughter's un-Islamic remarks. (He responded, saying they had been taken out of context.) Parliamentarians in an assembly in north-west Pakistan even debated her comments.\n\nYousafzai maintained a dignified silence. And then, in November 2021, she announced her surprise wedding to Pakistani cricket manager Asser Malik. Many, including myself, struggled to make sense of it.\n\n\"Malala, what happened?!\" I ask now as she walks, alone, into an empty conference room and greets me with a hug.\n\nShe smiles sheepishly. \"When you asked that question [about meeting someone],\" she says, \"I felt like I was caught. It was like, wait a second, does she know anything? I was like, no, no, no, you know, I just don't want to get married.\"\n\nIn Finding My Way, Yousafzai reveals that, by the time of the Vogue interview, she and Malik were already dating. In other words, Yousafzai over-corrected to throw me off the scent.\n\nBut she was sincere in having her doubts about marriage. Growing up in Pakistan, she says, it represented \"a future without any opportunity, where your husband determines your life\".\n\nAfter the furore, her parents, but particularly her mother, were distraught. \"She was so mad at me,\" Yousafzai says. Family and friends kept texting articles. An imam from her village called to lecture her parents on the phone. \"I was facing a lot of pressure,\" she says, \"from my dad, especially, and my mum, to issue a statement to clarify what my thoughts were on marriage, and I found this absurd.\"\n\nAnd then there was Malik. Yousafzai's parents had met him, but she hadn't felt ready to make the relationship public. She felt guilty for disavowing him publicly, but Malik didn't blame her, and instead stepped in to help mediate with her parents. Over the following months, Yousafzai began to interrogate her views on marriage. She asked Malik about his thoughts on women and equality, and liked what she heard. \"I'm supposed to be an advocate for girls and women, and even I was limiting my own self in how I perceived marriage,\" Yousafzai says.\n\nBut there were other pressures, familiar to any immigrant child who has butted up against their parents' cultural expectations. When Malik and Yousafzai left the house together, her mother would urge them to \"maintain, like, a 10-foot distance\", she says.\n\nIt seems from reading Finding My Way that she would not have married so young were it not for her parents. She nods. \"I felt like I was sort of giving up,\" she says. Refusing to marry would have led to not only interfamilial, but international, conflict. \"Am I willing to fight my mum and my dad? Am I willing to start a new debate on people living together without these ceremonies and traditions?\" Yousafzai realised that she couldn't live with Malik \"without getting married in the traditional way, in the religious way\".\n\nShe could dig her heels in, but it would cause immense pain to her parents. And, besides, she was in love. \"He's so charming, he's so smart, and I just could not stop thinking about him.\" So she relented. On 9 November 2021, at her parents' house in Birmingham, in an Islamic ceremony, Yousafzai married.\n\nAfter marriage, Yousafzai realised that \"things feel sort of the same. They're not that different.\" She lives with Malik in a riverside apartment in London. They split the chores; neither cooks, instead eating out or using a meal delivery service. (Yousafzai's mother thinks this is \"a disaster. She says, 'Your house is the only ahouse where there's a fridge with no vegetables!'\")\n\nIt has been only four years since we met, but Yousafzai is much changed. The woman I met before appeared girlish, even a little gauche. She was visibly mortified when we spoke about relationships. Now, she is grounded and at ease. She also looks subtly different, having undergone surgery to improve the facial paralysis she suffered after the attack.\n\nAt university, Yousafzai experienced the sweetness of independent adult life for the first time. When we met in 2021, she described a whirl of college balls, societies and essay crises. Now she's more willing to share the unvarnished reality of her university experience.\n\nIn Finding My Way, Yousafzai writes of the pressures of having to travel internationally, maintaining the relationships critical to the Malala Fund, which supports girls' education projects around the world, in addition to paid speaking gigs. She is the breadwinner not only for her parents and two brothers, but also for her extended family back home in Pakistan, and even family friends. (At one point, she was paying for two family friends to attend college, in the US and Canada.)\n\nDid she feel resentful of these financial obligations? \"It was difficult to manage,\" Yousafzai says. She \"hated the experience of thinking about our expenses for the next year and [thinking], OK, I have to do this event, because otherwise we won't be able to cover these costs.\"\n\nHer studies suffered. Yousafzai got a 2.2 in her first-year exams and had to seek additional support from specialist tutors, a humbling experience for the most famous education activist in the world. \"I felt like an impostor,\" she laughs. \"I felt ashamed.\" She asked her tutor to write a letter to her parents explaining that she was forbidden from working during term time because she was failing her degree. Why didn't she tell her parents herself? \"I had talked to my family many times about the pressure,\" she says, \"and how difficult it was to manage.\"\n\nShe writes of how, at home in Birmingham, \"my dad treated our house like an art museum, and me like the signature piece in the collection\". She would be summoned downstairs to meet visitors keen to gawp at a Nobel laureate up close. \"My dad is a very generous person,\" she says, \"a giving person, and he always understood what other people wanted ... in his heart, he knew that they wanted to meet me.\"\n\nHave there been times, I ask, where he's pushed you too much?\n\n\"Oh,\" she laughs, \"he has physically pushed me.\" When meeting well-wishers or guests at family events, Ziauddin has given her the odd shove. \"You know when you have a little kid, and you sort of push the kid [to] say hello to this person? I'm, like, it's fine when they're little kids, you know.\" But even when she's grouching, it's clear Yousafzai has tremendous love and respect for the man who, however inadvertently, propelled her on to the world stage. \"My dad has always been supportive,\" she says. \"Whenever I explain something to him, he completely understands it. He is one of those cool dads, who never disagrees with me.\"\n\nBut I fear even the world's most down-to-earth father may have concerns about what Yousafzai - whose new book is likely to be a bestseller (her first memoir sold nearly 2m copies) - is about to put in the public domain.\n\nAnd so to the bong incident. What happened that night: Yousafzai tried to walk back to her room, but she blacked out en route. A girlfriend carried her back instead. She couldn't sleep. Her brain endlessly replayed a loop of the day the Taliban attempted to murder her. The gun. The bloodspray. Her body being carried through crowds to an ambulance.\n\nShe had always thought she couldn't remember being shot. But the bong unlocked long-submerged memories, of the attack and also of a childhood growing up under the spectre of Taliban violence. \"I had never felt so close to the attack as then, in that moment,\" she tells me. \"I felt like I was reliving all of it, and there was a time when I just thought I was in the afterlife.\" She felt she was dying, or already dead. \"It's easier to laugh about it now,\" she says, with a small, tight smile.\n\nListening to her speak, I feel deep compassion for all she went through as a young child. \"I was nine or 10 when the Taliban took over control in our valley,\" she says, \"and they would bomb schools, they would kill or slaughter people and hang their bodies upside down.\"\n\nAfter the bong, Yousafzai developed anxiety. \"I felt numb ... I couldn't recognise myself in the mirror,\" she says. The sweetness of college life fell away. She told her parents in general terms about the incident, but \"they were a bit dismissive\", she says. She struggled to tell them how much it had affected her mental health. \"I just could not explain to them that things are not the same any more.\"\n\nFriends were worried about her. (Maria, her personal assistant, who lives in London, was so concerned she drove up to be with her immediately after the incident.) Yousafzai lied and told them things were fine. \"I'm the girl who was shot ... I'm supposed to be a brave girl,\" she says. Until she couldn't pretend any longer. \"I'd be sweating and shaking and I could hear my heart beat. Then I started getting panic attacks.\" She saw a therapist, and realised that her childhood, the attempted murder and exam stress were overwhelming her mental health. In the book, Yousafzai writes a list of her symptoms at the time: a racing heart, finding it hard to breathe, struggles sleeping, brain fog and a constant fear of someone she loved dying. \"Normal people don't have lists like this,\" she writes, adding, \"Something is wrong with me.\"\n\n\"I survived an attack,\" she says, \"and nothing happened to me, and I laughed it off. I thought nothing could scare me, nothing. My heart was so strong. And then I was scared of small things, and that just broke me. But, you know, in this journey I realised what it means to be actually brave. When you can not only fight the real threats out there, but fight within.\"\n\nHas becoming famous so young also had an impact? \"Yes,\" Yousafzai says, nodding emphatically. She talks about how young she was when she started winning awards, and what it was like to go to ceremonies and see activists there who had spent decades fighting for a cause. It made her feel as if she needed to \"spend the rest of my life campaigning for girls' education\" to show she was worthy.\n\nBut no matter how many leaders she lobbied, or projects she helped to fund - Yousafzai glows when she talks about the girls' school she opened back home - she felt it was not enough. There was \"always this feeling ... could I do more?\" Her youthful idealism began to flake and peel off in patches, and then rub clean away. \"As I was getting older,\" she says, \"I was realising that things are not as straightforward. Things are more complex.\"\n\nAs a teen, Yousafzai had seen the world as a biddable place. She would reason with world leaders! Show them girls' education was important! As she got older, she began to see the world as it really is.\n\nYou became cynical? I ask.\n\n\"Yeah,\" she says, \"for sure.\" She gives a bitter, clipped laugh. \"100%.\"\n\nIn April 2021, the US announced it was withdrawing from Afghanistan in August of that year. Within days of them leaving, the Taliban took over the country. \"We had calls with the Afghan activists who the Malala Fund were supporting,\" she says, \"and it was just unbelievable. Some of them knew the worst was coming. Some of them still had faith.\"\n\nAfghanistan is now the only country in the world where girls cannot go to secondary school or higher education, with the only option available being madrasas that promote an extreme interpretation of Islam. The Malala Fund continues to do what it can. \"We are providing funding for alternative education right now,\" she says. \"There are underground schools, there are radio and television education programmes.\"\n\nYousafzai is heartbroken at what has come to pass. \"I feel the world has forgotten about the women in Afghanistan,\" she says. What stings is that \"people were willing to trust the Taliban more than Afghan women\". Which people, I ask? \"World leaders,\" she says, \"decision makers.\"\n\nYousafzai writes of emailing politicians, begging for their assistance in evacuating her Afghan partners to safety before the Taliban took over. \"For years, I'd smiled in pictures with these leaders, shaken their hands and stood next to them at podiums - but not one of them picked up the phone, or replied to my messages. To the men who ran the world, I was just a photo op.\"\n\nWho didn't take her calls? She mentions Biden. Johnson. Macron. Trudeau. She notes, pointedly, that female politicians did. Erna Solberg, the then Norwegian prime minister, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and Lolwah Al-Khater, assistant foreign minister of Qatar at the time, stepped in to help evacuate her Afghan partners to safe countries, in some instances without passports.\n\nFor many years, Yousafzai pioneered a model of professional activism: cautious, consensus-driven, willing to work with institutions, rather than calling them out; one that used the photo op and the handshake, rather than the megaphone and the protest. Her detractors said she was too corporate, but Yousafzai sincerely believed it was better to work with people and make incremental change. And then Afghanistan happened. Did she feel duped?\n\n\"I do feel like I'm more cynical,\" she says. \"But, at the same time, I do my work. I know that optimism is the only way you can keep going, because there's no other option.\"\n\nThere is a perception on social media that, as one of the most prominent Muslim activists in the world today, Yousafzai has not done enough to speak out on Gaza. This perception is not entirely fair. Through the Malala Fund, and personally, Yousafzai has donated hundreds of thousands of pounds to organisations that support children and schools in Gaza. She first called for a ceasefire on 10 October 2023.\n\nToday, it is Yousafzai who brings up Gaza. \"Israel has to stop this indiscriminate bombing,\" she says. Humanitarian aid must be allowed in, she adds, characterising the starvation of civilians as \"deliberate\". But, still, the perception lingers. Her critics, she says, \"completely are dismissing or ignoring the actual work that I'm doing\".\n\nYousafzai describes what is happening in Gaza as \"a genocide\". \"You look at the evidence, you look at what's happening, you look at how they're [the IDF] committing these actions, and it's very clear if they're targeting people for collecting aid, or getting water. Everyone knows children are unarmed.\" She also calls for the release of the surviving hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza in appalling conditions. \"I've been very consistent in saying that the hostages should be freed ... I don't believe in using violence for resistance.\"\n\nDoes she think she has done enough? \"I wish I lived in a world where I could do a tweet and the world would stop the war.\" After we meet, Yousafzai travels to Egypt to meet injured Palestinian child refugees, and announces a $100,000 grant from the Malala Fund to support their medical treatment and education.\n\n\"There isn't a night where I don't think about what I can do,\" she says.\n\nThroughout the 2010s, Yousafzai was the most prominent of a wave of child activists - such as the climate-change campaigners Greta Thunberg and Vanessa Nakate, or gun-control advocate Emma González (now X González) - feted by world leaders, invited to events, on the covers of magazines, writing bestselling memoirs, delivering speeches to adoring audiences. This cultural moment has now passed. The celebrity activist feels like a relic of a different era. Many question what these activists achieved.\n\nThe Malala Fund supports girls' education projects in six countries. In order to maintain the funding streams, Yousafzai has to cultivate relationships with funders and world leaders, inevitably leading to accusations of selling out. Most of the people who slam her online will never achieve a fraction of what she has done for girls around the world. But it can at times be jarring to see Yousafzai enjoying an international jet-set lifestyle - days out at Formula One and at Taylor Swift concerts - interspersed with posts about Gaza or the plight of Afghan girls.\n\nShe is often compared unfavourably by her critics, particularly those on the left, with Thunberg, who is willing to put herself in physical danger, boarding the Freedom Flotilla and setting sail for Gaza. \"I really look up to Greta,\" says Yousafzai, adding she checked in with her after she was detained by Israeli authorities.\n\nIn April 2024, Yousafzai attended the opening night of Suffs, a Broadway musical about the suffragettes that she executive produced. Also in attendance was Hillary Clinton, a fellow executive producer. Online commentators flamed Yousafzai for being associated with the hawkish former secretary of state. In reality, Yousafzai says, she didn't realise that Clinton was an executive producer on the project until after she had been brought on, and they did not work together on it.\n\n\"People say, 'Oh, you're at the Suffs premiere, you are an executive producer, oh, Hillary Clinton has these views, therefore you support these views, therefore you are also complicit.\"\n\nBeing photographed at the same star-studded premiere as Clinton, rightly or wrongly, reinforces a persistent criticism of Yousafzai in Pakistan: that she is in the pocket of western powers; there are even longstanding rumours that she is an intelligence asset. When I ask her about this, she pushes back. \"Pakistan is a part of me,\" she says, \"and so I get defensive when I'm asked this question. I say, no, no, no, Pakistan doesn't hate me.\"\n\nShe fears that by giving succour to the view that she is unpopular in Pakistan, she feeds into broader anti-Muslim sentiment: the idea that Pakistan is a country full of backwards people who instinctively hate educated women. \"I believe,\" she says, \"and it is deliberate, on my side, that I have a lot more love and support in Pakistan.\" But, equally, she says, \"I'm not going to deny there isn't any hint [of hatred] at all. There is. There have been these campaigns from when I was, like, 12 years old.\n\n\"The criticism is not against me,\" she adds. \"It's more criticism against the west, criticism against these bigger narratives, and political conversations, but I am sort of attached to it.\"\n\nStill, it's clear to see it wears on her. \"I do find it sad,\" she admits, \"that I sometimes have to read everything 10 times before I post it, because I'm, like, what is it that will get people's attention?\n\nIt is difficult. I do wish for more freedom in expressing myself.\"\n\nAfter I wrap up the section of the interview on politics, Yousafzai exhales with relief and stretches her arms out in front of her, as if we are colleagues who have just finished a difficult task and can now relax with a cup of tea and a biscuit. By contrast, when it comes to talking about her family and her relationship with Malik, she speaks freely, laughing often. She is happiest when talking about her plans for Recess, an investment fund with a focus on women's sports that she recently launched with Malik.\n\nRecess isn't a non-profit, as I initially assumed. It's a business, with the aim of increasing participation in women's sports. Malik helped Yousafzai find her love of exercise. The fact that Malik is a cricket manager was part of his initial appeal, says the cricket-mad Yousafzai, even if her husband refuses to let her watch him play. \"He says,\" Yousafzai says, with an eye roll, \"'I used to work in cricket management! I was not a professional cricketer!' I'm, like, uh-huh. He did not explain that before marriage.\" She hopes that Recess will \"create more opportunities for women in sports\" and help women \"get a say in sports at all levels, whether that's from the field to the owner's box\".\n\nBefore we leave, I ask Yousafzai if her parents have read Finding My Way. She says she has given them the gist of it, but they have not read it. \"I have told them, 'You will read it when it's released, and you can pick it up from any bookshelf in any bookstore, and feel free to read it, but then you cannot make any changes.'\"\n\nI understand the logic, familiar to many first- and second-generation immigrant children, including myself. Ask for forgiveness, not permission. But I'm also floored. Because Yousafzai is a global figure: the bong story will, inevitably, unleash a maelstrom of negative publicity back home.\n\nShe is ready. \"I am very prepared for that,\" Yousafzai says, absolutely calm. \"I don't think I'm going to get defensive about it at all. I'm not going to issue any statement. If anybody has any confusion, they can read my book and decide for themselves.\"\n\nIt strikes me as I walk away from our interview that she never chose any of this. To be shot as a child, to be airlifted to the UK, to win the Nobel peace prize. Yousafzai seems to be someone who consistently puts others before herself, whether it's accommodating her parents' cultural expectations around marriage, supporting her family back home, or dedicating her life to advancing girls' education. \"I'm working so hard to learn how to say no,\" she says, \"and to be more direct ... I do sort of overthink about other people's feelings sometimes.\"\n\nIf the story of her teens and early 20s was of service to others, her late 20s are about Yousafzai choosing happiness for herself. I think she deserves it.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.30429090063978426,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Malala Yousafzai\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"PAK\",\n    \"quote\": \"My life has changed for ever.

According to a July survey for the Left-leaning Middle East Understanding Policy Project, 62pc of Mamdani voters in June's Democratic primary said his support for Palestinian rights heavily influenced their decision to back him. The same survey revealed that some 46pc said Mamdani's willingness to criticise the Israeli government helped secure their vote.\n\nBoth Eric Adams, the city's outgoing mayor, and Andrew Cuomo, who lost to Mamdani in his attempt to secure the Democratic mayoral nomination and who is now running as an independent, have also understood this dynamic. Adams leant heavily into his pro-Israel record, while Cuomo went as far as to declare back in April that anti-Semitism was \"the most serious and the most important issue\" in his campaign.\n\nNow as the Gaza war comes to a close, with aid set to pour in and Israel's hostages returning home, how will it affect a mayoral campaign caught in its crossfire? The answer, like so much of this campaign, remains nail-biting and uncertain.\n\nOne scenario is that a race dominated by charges of \"genocide\" and threats to arrest Benjamin Netanyahu will revert to more traditional issues. Public safety, affordable housing, school choice, corporate responsibility, all have been overshadowed by Israel and Gaza.\n\nThis would present both opportunities and challenges. Mamdani's unorthodox and often radical stances on police patrols, government-run grocery stores and rent-freezes could now face even more scrutiny without the din of Palestine to distract attention. Meanwhile, the charges of listless (if not downright lifeless) campaigning that have plagued Cuomo will become even louder if attacks on Mamdani's stance on Israel lose salience.\n\nThere might be a renewed focus on both men's contentious political records, the weaknesses inherent in Mamdani's relative inexperience as well as the very real successes and scandals associated with Cuomo, a former governor of New York. Cuomo has managed to avoid too much attention on past allegations of sexual harassment, in part thanks to the overwhelming interest in the Israel-Hamas war. One of his latest attack lines has been to paint Mamdani's donors as extremists.\n\nSo the optimistic scenario is that the end of the Gaza war could give New York what it's deserved all along, a race defined by the real struggles confronting real New Yorkers. This could end up being disproportionately bad for Mamdani, given the outsized role of the conflict in motivating his voters.\n\nThere is, of course, an alternative scenario, one less benign for the future of New York politics. The new electoral coalition that is powering Mamdani's campaign might have been formed in the aftermath of October 7 and the subsequent Gazan war, but it has since morphed into something that could last much longer than the conflict itself. The Left has for years been searching for a cause that unites voters as disparate as LGBTQ progressives and conservative migrants. Now they have found one in Palestinianism, they won't let go of it easily.\n\nAnd in New York, that anti-Zionist movement might be more powerful even than the president himself. Indeed, having threatened to both withhold billions of dollars in federal funding from New York and send in federal troops to patrol its neighbourhoods, Trump certainly doesn't lack for \"surprises\". But with Mamdani continuing to surge, the biggest surprise may be just how little power even a \"peace-maker\" like Trump possesses to stop him.\n\nDavid Christopher Kaufman is a former New York Post editor</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-6.593406846788194,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Andrew Cuomo\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"Candidate for New York City Mayor\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"the most serious and the most important issue\",\n    \"message\": \"Anti-Semitism is the most serious and important issue in his campaign for New York City Mayor.\"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP"}],"createTime":"2025-10-15T10:37:26.387520Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"ZnnvaMDTF_XZnvgPisGa2A0","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":90,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":90}],"promptTokenCount":1133,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1133}],"thoughtsTokenCount":2308,"totalTokenCount":3531,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}}}

Dehumanisation and militarised terror both seem normalised now\n\nIt's clear what Israel's western-facilitated genocide has done to Gaza. But what has it done to us? Palestinians are the \"canaries in a coalmine\", the Palestinian analyst Muhammad Shehada tells me. \"We're screaming of a major warning of what's about to come your way. When you have a media-political class that's relishing, delighting in the murder of our children, do you think they're going to care about yours?\"\n\nThere is a warning from our recent, terrifying past that we should heed. Colonialism, warned Martinican author Aimé Césaire, \"works to decivilise the coloniser, to brutalise him in the true sense of the word, to degrade him, to awaken him to buried instincts, to covetousness, violence, race hatred, and moral relativism\". The horrors of western imperialism - with its dehumanisation and violence - were, he argued, ultimately redirected into Europe in the form of fascism. This was the imperial \"boomerang\", as the German-American philosopher Hannah Arendt agreed.\n\nWhat will boomerang back to the west from the killing fields of Gaza? Every genocide requires the total dehumanisation of its victims, and Palestinians are no exception. They were \"human animals\" and \"human beasts\" who would suffer \"hell\", declared Israeli leaders. \"It is an entire nation out there that is responsible,\" said Israeli president Isaac Herzog. Other Israeli politicians called for \"erasing all of Gaza from the face of the Earth\". \"It is not a far stretch to say there are very few innocent Palestinian civilians,\" declared Republican Congressman Brian Mast, while Fox News host Jesse Waters labelled Palestinians \"savages\".\n\nBut this dehumanisation goes beyond its most violent expressions. There has been no pretence that a Palestinian life has even a fraction of the worth of an Israeli life. Look at what has been normalised. Hospitals bombed and destroyed, with more than 1,700 health workers killed. Civilians massacred while sheltering in schools. More than 2,600 starving Palestinians gunned down trying to collect food since May. Teenagers shot in different parts of the body \"like a game of target practice\", as British surgeon Dr Nick Maynard testified: \"One day they'd be coming in predominately with gunshot wounds to the head or the neck, another day to the chest, another day to the abdomen.\" Industrialised torture against detainees, from amputations of legs caused by handcuff injuries, to Israeli soldiers reportedly taking turns to rape a man with M16 rifles.\n\nWe could go on, but these are all horrors that are among humanity's darkest moments. That they were facilitated by western governments, and cheered on or simply tolerated by western media outlets, will have profound consequences. So will the fact that westerners who protested against this wanton barbarism were demonised, sacked, deplatformed, beaten by police officers, arrested, menaced with deportation. So too will the destruction of whatever remained of an \"international order\", torpedoed to protect Israel from accountability, as was the case when international criminal court judges were sanctioned by the US after it issued arrest warrants against Israeli leaders for war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nIsrael's government has shifted further to the right and has sought ties with global far-right movements, such as those in France, Sweden, Spain and Hungary, understanding that such parties are its most reliable cheerleaders. Israel's minister of diaspora and combating antisemitism even invited Tommy Robinson on an official visit - declaring him \"a courageous leader on the front line against radical Islam\".\n\nThe western far-right see Israel as a model: an ethno-state waging what they see as a righteous war against Islam. The leader of Spain's far-right Vox party declared: \"We Europeans need to see what is happening to Israel,\" demanding that to protect itself, Europe must \"stop massive immigration and expel illegal immigrants. We do not want a Muslim Europe.\" When Israel passed a law granting the right to self-determination only to Jewish people, Dutch far-right leader Geert Wilders hailed it as \"fantastic\", an \"example for us all\", demanding his people \"define our own nation-state, our indigenous culture, our language and flag ... it will help prevent us becoming Islamic.\"\n\nListen to Israeli scholar Shmuel Lederman when he argues that Gaza became \"a laboratory for genocidal violence\" - but also a testing ground for \"new weapons and security technologies.\" Israel, notes Australian journalist Antony Loewenstein, has long tested its inventions on Palestinians, and then exported them: spyware, facial recognition and biometric databases, drones, smart fences and AI-enabled targeting systems.\n\nRight now, Palestinians are sifting through rubble to recover their dead, praying that the genocidal onslaught ends for good, while the aid trucks Israel blocked finally arrive. But as Donald Trump observed earlier this year: \"A civilisation has been wiped out in Gaza.\" In the wake of the great crimes of history, there has always been a debate about what was known at the time. Despite Israel's campaign of lies, distortion, deflection, gaslighting, muddying of the waters: we all knew. Not all the hideous details - whitewashed as they were by most media outlets - but more than enough. Israel's crimes were not hidden: its leaders boasted of them, and they were live-streamed for the world to see.\n\nThe price paid by Palestinians is beyond our imagination. But what price will we pay? The west has dehumanised itself, just as a far-right movement that sees Muslims and the left as enemies within is on the rise. After the US bombed Venezuelan boats allegedly smuggling drugs, the US attorney general promised \"the same approach with antifa: destroy the entire organisation, from top to bottom. We're going to take them apart.\" \"Antifa\" - or antifascism - is a phantom, a bogeyman that can be applied to any leftwing dissidents.\n\nDo not expect the violent dehumanisation and dystopian military technologies perfected in Gaza to remain there. Our dark history tells us otherwise. What a pity we did not heed its lessons.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.4011877447889007,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Muhammad Shehada\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"PLE\",\n    \"quote\": \"We're screaming of a major warning of what's about to come your way.

It's when your captors have to show their hand, when security forces might pounce, and when the slightest wrong move may spark a bloodbath. Often the only way through it is to cling to the hope that a hug with loved ones is not far off.\n\nSuch was the case for Hamas hostage Eli Sharabi, for whom light at the end of tunnel came quite literally on Feb 8 this year, after 16 months in the so-called Gaza Metro, the terror group's warren of underground hideouts. First, he was paraded on stage for a tasteless photo-op before a mob of baying locals, fearing he may be torn apart. Then, once handed over to the Israeli army, he asked when he could be re-united with his Bristol-born wife Lianne, and daughters, Yahel, 13, and Noiya, 16, who were with him when Hamas attacked their home in Kibbutz Be'eri on October 7. Only then did he learn that they had been killed, just minutes after he had been dragged away.\n\nSharabi had long feared as much. But as he writes in his new book Hostage, to get through the horrors of captivity, he had to \"cling to the belief that they were still alive\". Two months later, accompanied by two psychologists in case it all got too much, Sharabi visited his loved ones' graves, sobbing for 40 minutes. Then he left, remarking: \"This here is rock bottom.

Event cancellations, book bans, and coordinated harassment campaigns have proliferated through schools, libraries, and bookstores, targeting authors who have either written about Palestinian life and culture, have supported Palestinian rights, or been caught in the backlash simply for their visibly Muslim identity.\n\nFor the Palestinian American authors among them, the pattern reminds them of an uncomfortable and peculiar reality: that their very existence is threatening, and sharing idyllic stories that define their childhood - however innocent - can trigger organized campaigns accusing them of seeding antisemitism and hatred.\n\nAccording to 2024 research by author and educator Nora Lester Murad, there have been 114 English-language children's books explicitly centering Palestinian narratives exist for K-12 readers. There has been an uptick in recent years - 44% of Palestinian children's books since 1998 were published between 2019 and 2023. Yet much of this increase comes from self-publishing, with 32% of recent titles self-published as traditional publishers remain reluctant gatekeepers.\n\n\"It's this effort to reject the people,\" Matari said. \"Now that we've broken through this industry and there's more books coming out, it's like ... we can't stop people from reading your story. So we can stop people from getting to know you, or connecting the authors with the stories that they write.\"\n\n\"Freedom of speech isn't afforded to everybody in this country, especially if you're Palestinian,\" she added.\n\nThe first full week of October is Banned Books Week in the US and is a time meant to highlight censored voices. Yet pro-Palestinian authors are finding themselves at the center of a new form of literary censorship, though the books being challenged don't advocate political positions or promote hatred. They tell simple stories of gardens and olive trees, of children navigating identity and language, of family traditions preserved across generations, leading authors to come to the conclusion that it's their existence that appears to be the provocation.\n\n\"In addition to disconnecting us from our land and from our people,\" Matari said, \"now they're trying to disconnect us from our stories.\"\n\nWhat started with angry emails and last-minute cancellations is also becoming encoded in state policy. On 7 October, California governor Gavin Newsom signed a pair of bills into law designed to combat hate and antisemitism in schools. One new law establishes an office of civil rights and an antisemitism prevention coordinator, and requires districts to investigate and take corrective action when \"discriminatory content is used in classrooms or professional development\".\n\nThe concern swirling in the world of children authors is that the vague language could be used to label their books and their stories as discriminatory, giving state officials legal cover to further suppress Palestinian narratives from schools, and perhaps see these restrictions expand in other states and professional settings.\n\nEarlier this month, Hannah Moushabeck received a call about an upcoming speaking engagement at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, where she had been invited to discuss her book Homeland: My Father Dreams of Palestine and the censorship attempts against it. University administrators told her that her book violated North Carolina's compelled speech and neutrality law because it \"doesn't show two sides to the story\". Moushabeck could attend the event, administrators told her, but she was prohibited from reading from her book.\n\nBut it's hardly the first experience with censorship this author had to endure. Moushabeck said she's had five visits cancelled since 2023 and the threats became physical at her nephew's elementary school in Amherst, Massachusetts, last year. \"I had to arrive at the school at six o'clock in the morning and go in through the back with a security escort,\" Moushabeck said. A Jewish friend accompanied her for additional protection while school security and police remained on standby. \"I remember having to do my school visit and keep a smile on my face and keep incredibly calm, because I really didn't want my nephew to see that we were at risk.\"\n\nAt Germantown Friends, a Quaker school in Philadelphia, Jamilah Thompkins-Bigelow was scheduled for an all-day visit to launch her book Sister Friend - a story about friendship between a Black girl and a Muslim classmate who wears a hijab. A couple days before the October 2023 event, administrators announced a postponement.\n\n\"They felt that in the time that we were in, it was a protective measure,\" Thompkins-Bigelow recalled. What followed was months of rescheduling without firm dates, culminating in contract termination in February 2024 after around 150 Jewish parents demanded the school remain \"a safe space for Jewish students\".\n\n\"I felt like the microscope was on me as soon as they recognized that, oh, this is a Muslim author and she said something about Palestine,\" Thompkins-Bigelow, who wears a hijab, said. \"You have to prove that you're innocent of being an antisemite if you have any kind of pro-Palestinian commentary. Even just saying, 'Here's a link to donate to Palestinian kids' - that becomes political.\"\n\nAutumn Allen faced similar targeting last year when two of her planned school visits were canceled, one in the Sharon city school district in Pennsylvania just days before the event.\n\nAllen, who writes young adult novels and picture books, was scheduled to discuss her work when parents began flooding the administration with complaints after seeing promotional materials. But the content of her writing wasn't the issue. Instead, complaints sent to school administrators cited her social media posts about Palestinian rights.\n\nThe Sharon district and another school in Brookline where she was an alumna buckled under pressure from what Allen described as \"a handful of very loud\" voices creating \"this urgency and this feeling of horror\" about her visit.\n\n\"It's never about the content of the talk. It's always about who I am as a person,\" Allen said. \"And at the end of the day the parents were saying they were going to show up at protests and [the administrator] said they didn't want to make a scene in front of the kids.\"\n\nEgyptian American author Aya Khalil said her book The Arabic Quilt was removed from Pennsylvania's Central York district not because anyone objected to its story but because \"diverse\" books were the target. \"They didn't even read the book. They're just like, OK, we're gonna remove these books from the shelf.\"\n\nAfterwards, she started to notice how her own bookings dropped dramatically after being outspoken about the censorship surrounding Palestine and Palestinian authors, illustrators, creatives and educators.\n\n\"A lot of them haven't been getting invited to schools or they have been getting their author visits canceled,\" Khalil said. \"I used to get maybe 10 to 15 libraries per year.\" Now she rarely fields requests.\n\nIronically, the attempted suppression has sometimes backfired. Matari's book sold out its first printing of 5,000 copies before it reached store shelves, and Khalil estimates 10,000 copies of her books were purchased in the York school district, largely due to community support mobilized in response to the cancellations and bans.\n\nFor Khalil, the experience led her to write a new book, The Great Banned-Books Bake Sale, about a girl who organizes a bake sale to buy back banned books, eventually leading to a reversal of the ban.\n\nAt least one author has been able to rebuff attempts to cancel her events. Maysa Odeh, whose debut book A Map for Falasteen, about a little girl named Falasteen learning about her roots, faced removal attempts in Watertown, Massachusetts, in an organized campaign by a group called End Jew Hatred. Watertown officials were flooded with thousands of complaint emails following the call to action to cut it from the second-grade summer reading list, but the library stood their ground.\n\n\"I can't really get into the mind of the person who read my book and felt threatened by it,\" Odeh said.\n\nAt the National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) conference last November, Odeh and other authors required security after being targeted by the pro-Israel media organization Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting and Analysis (Camera), which has been long accused of smear and intimidation tactics. The group, which also runs an education institute, attends teaching conferences, and has continued to document and monitor pro-Palestine voices.\n\n\"I kind of went into it blind and when I realized they were there, I reached out to my publisher, and NCTE offered a security guard,\" Odeh said about Camera's presence at NCTE. \"They're like, we can't get rid of them ... a security guard was there at my panel on building empathy through picture books.\"\n\n\"Once I was on these conservative social media channels, the onslaught was unrelenting,\" Moushabeck said. Camera has written \"five separate articles\" about her, \"and when you Google me, some of the first articles that come up\" are from them. \"I noticed that when people were criticizing my book, they were pulling direct quotes from those articles.\"\n\nAnd for new authors such as Jenan Matari, the cancellations are about more than book talks and school visits - they are about who gets to tell their own stories. The pressure campaigns, the threats, the social media monitoring and the overarching bans have only reinforced what she already knew: that some voices are still seen as too dangerous to be heard.\n\n\"They couldn't stop people from reading about Palestine,\" she said. \"So now they're trying to stop people from meeting the authors who write about it.\"</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.40597789997650086,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Safa Suleiman\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"Author\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"I never saw myself in children's books growing up, and I was about to share my book with children who may never have seen themselves in children's books either,\",\n    \"message\": \"The speaker never saw themselves represented in children's books while growing up and was looking forward to sharing their own book with children who might also lack such representation.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Jenan Matari\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"Author\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"It's this effort to reject the people.

After all, almost every day is the Donald Trump Show and there was no way the US president was going to share the limelight on this of all days. The day when the living Israeli hostages were freed, 1,900 Palestinian detainees were freed and the first aid trucks entered Gaza.\n\nThis was The Donald's peace deal. A narcissist is going to narcissise. Everyone else reduced to supporting actors. At best. Keir was relegated to a non-speaking walk on part as an extra. Pushed away after a couple of seconds. Probably preferable to being arm-wrestled like Emmanuel Macron. Though not much.\n\nCome Tuesday, Keir Starmer was back in the UK and ready to make a statement to the Commons on the situation in Gaza. One that was altogether more nuanced than much that had been said the day before. One where the celebrations were tempered with a cautious pragmatism. The ceasefire was only the first tentative, necessary step on the way to a permanent peace. No one could take anything for granted. War had become a way of life in the Middle East. It was still possible for everything to turn to dust in a matter of weeks.\n\nFirst though, a shout out to Donald Trump. Through whom all things are possible. Everyone is obliged to thank The Donald for everything these days. He has spies who are paid to keep tabs on all his mentions. Any mentions that are less than hagiographical are regarded with disapproval. On the president's hitlist. Here's the thing. The Donald hasn't orchestrated a ceasefire because he regards it as a moral duty. Part of his office. But because he is doing the world a favour. Everything is transactional. He needs adoration. And a Nobel peace prize.\n\nThat done, Starmer could move on. Britain had offered its full support to the peace process. Had worked tirelessly behind the scenes, with no need of recognition. Because it was our job. Recognising a Palestinian state had allowed other Arab nations to condemn Hamas. And we knew a thing or two about decommissioning weapons from the Good Friday agreement. But it was going to be a long haul. The Donald wasn't the first person to come to the Middle-East promising \"Everlasting Peace\" and that hadn't worked out especially well. You can have too many Messiahs.\n\nWhat to say about Kemi Badenoch's reply? Obviously, Kemi comes with one severe psychological impairment. Everything for her is a fight. Her against the world. Her against the Labour party. She looks on any form of agreement as a sign of profound weakness. She just can't go there. But there's also another possible explanation for her behaviour. That she is nowhere near as bright as she imagines herself to be. If she finds a stick, she has the uncanny knack of always picking the wrong end.\n\nAfter a fairly neutral opening couple of sentences in which she welcomed the return of the hostages - she had nothing to say about the return of the Palestinians or the reconstruction of Gaza: she takes her partisanship seriously - Kemi started launching an attack on Starmer and the country's status in the world. For someone who often likes to say how much she loves the UK, she sure spends a lot of time talking it down. And if she really thinks the country is beyond saving, then maybe she and the Tory party could take some responsibility.\n\nThe prime minister was just welcoming the terrorists back into Gaza, she said. Except he wasn't. He had spoken at length about Hamas having no part in a future Palestinian state. Kemi was not to be denied. Starmer had damaged relations with Israel. We had played no part in the ceasefire agreement. Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador to Israel, had said it was delusional to imagine we had. She didn't seem to have clocked the Steve Witkoff tweet praising the efforts of the national security adviser, Jonathan Powell.\n\nIt was all properly batshit. Here was parliament discussing the most promising peace initiative in the Middle East for the best part of three decades and Kemi just wanted to try to score points off the Labour party. More worryingly, she appeared to have no idea how peace negotiations actually worked.\n\nThat you needed a plan to which both sides could agree. There had to be something in it for everyone. And sometimes you need to be able to tell your allies some home truths. That something has got to give. That it might have helped the process for the US and the UK to have disagreed on some matters. Sometimes you have to wonder if Kemi is a serious politician.\n\nThat was certainly the conclusion all her backbenchers seemed to have reached. All those who spoke after her ignored what she had said. They weren't going to stoop to her level. This was a time for them to be better than that. After all, what chance was there for a lasting peace in the Middle East, if the Commons couldn't even reach some kind of consensus?\n\nOne after the other, the Tory MPs lined up to implicitly condemn their leader. Edward Leigh was first to speak. He was concerned not just that Hamas were openly executing Palestinians, but that nothing had been agreed either on ending the illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank or on the formation of a Palestinian state. Kemi would have just been happy for the Palestinians to live among the rubble for eternity.\n\nOthers soon followed. Andrew Mitchell, Julian Lewis, Kit Malthouse. Even Oliver Dowden couldn't find a nice word to say in support of Kemi. Their contributions were all measured and constructive. Rising to the occasion. Keir made a point of thanking each and everyone of them. They were from a former Conservative party which he had once known and respected. Another world.\n\nEven Richard Tice came across as the voice of reason. A surreal moment for all of us. You get the feeling that deep down, Dicky is an establishment man through and through.

I posted some pictures about it on social media, but had not yet alluded to the events of that terrible day. A dear Israeli friend contacted me and asked about my silence; the sweetest man I know, he sounded hurt and confused, even a little bit angry, that I was going around having a nice time by the English sea while his country - the one I had always noisily defended - was in paroxysms of agony.\n\nI explained that I had been writing in longer-form about the horror and its implications in the rest of the world, but hadn't felt social media was the right place for it yet. But his hurt got to me. I decided to go to Israel as soon as possible, and got tickets for late November 2023. I was about five months pregnant at the time (I went again in January 2024, at over seven months pregnant).\n\nI felt - and feel - that Israelis should not be made to feel like lepers, however the world portrayed them. If Israel is good enough for all the Jews who live there, it is good enough for me.\n\nI found a country that was stunned. Bars and restaurants were shut for longer than any other time outside Covid lockdowns. People were in mourning and shock; they did not show their signature ebullience on the streets. All was muted. Israelis across the political spectrum explained to me that the hostages' fate was also their country's fate, and that the single most important thing was to get them back. That Israel was no longer Israel if they were kidnapped in Gaza.\n\nBack in London, I had long conversations with a close friend who grew up in a more Zionist tradition than I did. To her, Zionism means leaving no one behind: to fail to do everything to get the hostages back above all else meant the end of Zionism. She was distraught at the prospect of that happening. That view made a big impression on me, even if I could never fully get on board with the endless deal-making that went nowhere with a bunch of sadists. Or leaving those sadists in power.\n\nWhat happened on October 7 in Israel has not just haunted Israelis, but all decent people, Jewish or not for two years. The hostages have been a mote in the eye, and brain, that could not be shifted. Jewish friends with babies and small children were plagued by horrifying visions and terrors: what if it were their beautiful little babies at home in Nir Oz or Kfar Aza? Or anywhere?\n\nI understood their intolerable hauntings soon after when I had my own baby. You'd have to be hard-hearted not to also, therefore, extend empathy to mothers in Gaza, made to endure much suffering by the hideous war their leaders zestfully started and continued to wage, without mercy, and put them in the crosshairs.\n\nWhat the Gazan barbarians did to the Israeli women they got their hands on was an unmanageable kaleidoscope of horrors. It also evoked the deep sense of terror that lurks below many Jews' consciousness: after all, what Hamas did to those Jewish babies and grandmas and mothers and fathers was what the SS did; the same goal and the same end result; the same unfathomable zest for cruelty and murder of Jewish innocents.\n\nMost Jews have some connection, visceral or material, with Israel. It was hard to watch as our homeland was thrown into chaos, division and misery, something the late October 7 mastermind Yahya Sinwar, an expert on Israeli society since his time in prison there, predicted.\n\nBut then we also had to reckon with the extension of the pogrom in the rest of the world. From high to low, from the respectable to the rabble, from Australia and Yemen to France and Canada, from the organs of prestige to populist social media, the world set about obliterating the fact of those tortured and kidnapped on October 7.\n\nInstead of extending understanding of the most basic kind, including to Israel's entirely necessary response, the world blood-libelled, denigrated and gaslit Israelis and those of us who defended them. The victims of October 7have been boycotted, ostracised, lied about, and insulted.\n\nIn return for Hamas's bloody frenzy, the West's great bodies of state and diplomacy, such as the UN and the ICJ, have sought to destroy Israeli legitimacy, livelihoods and safety with venomous campaigns of lawfare, motions, criminalisation and, above all, the spreading of fake news.\n\nThat Israel has committed a genocide in Gaza is now taken as read, from restaurant news websites advertising Gaza solidarity supper clubs to major news organisations. The sick thing is that it is Hamas who have explicit genocidal ambitions against the Jews of Israel, and, in many cases, beyond.\n\nFor the legions of Hamas-supporting fiends - from the mad ghoul Greta Thunberg to the rest of the \"globalise the intifada\" movement to your average well-meaning useful idiot doing Hamas's bidding - the hostages have been like ghosts. If they are mentioned, they are portrayed as little more than 3-D printouts weaponised by a scheming, demonic Israel.\n\nA recent post of Thunberg's, after her second attempt to ensnare Israel in yet more bad PR and the fake thicket of international law violations with her ludicrous \"aid\" flotilla headed for Gaza, is telling. Railing about the \"suffering\" of Palestinians held in Israeli jails, she posted pictures of a few men looking sorry, with the text: \"The suffering of Palestinian prisoners is not a matter of opinion - it is a fact of systematic cruelty and dehumanisation. Humanity cannot be selective.\"\n\nExcept one of the men whose picture she posted was none other Evyatar David, one of the hostages still in captivity, emaciated and shown marking a date on a calendar as to when he last ate. \"Every minute you are not deleting the post, you are becoming a bigger joke,\" wrote his sister Yaela under Thunberg's post. If only.\n\nIndeed Thunberg, while one of the more visible of this crew, is far from being the only one who revels in the appalling mix of evil callousness and ignorance that defines the Gaza brigade. Few mention the hostages in their endless denunciation of Israel, let alone understand why they represent a near-mortal blow against all that is right in the world.\n\nCNN opened a news article about October 7 last week with this strange line: \"It's been two years since Israel launched its war in Gaza.\" The broadcaster never seemed to remember the hostages, or have an inkling of their significance in the war.\n\nBut if those who have called for an end to the war since the start were serious, they'd certainly have remembered the hostages. They'd have yelled for Hamas to release them, upon which the war would have instantly ended. But they didn't. For them, this was never about ending a war, or the Palestinians, or the \"humanity\" Thunberg shouts about. Because the hostages were nobodies to them. But luckily to the people that matter, the hostages were everything, and that is why, with any luck, they are coming home at last.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.489356610414793,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Greta Thunberg\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"The suffering of Palestinian prisoners is not a matter of opinion - it is a fact of systematic cruelty and dehumanisation.

Shahada had met the boy while fishing at the port and then lured him to the monastery.\n\nAlongside another accomplice, Shahada raped the teenager and then killed him by hitting him over the head with an iron bar.\n\nAt the time of Shahada's conviction, Oren's family had demanded the death penalty, arguing that a \"life sentence isn't enough\".</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.7421842876233553,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Kati\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"Oren's mother\",\n    \"nationality\": \"ISR\",\n    \"quote\": \"It's a shock to me, I never imagined he would be included in the deal.

The news last week was \"a doozy\", he said. \"It's less 'we didn't start the fire' and more 'everything's on fire.'\"\n\nColbert provided a partial list of what he missed in a single week: the government shutdown headed into its third week; Trump fired more than 4,000 federal workers; the Department of Justice, under pressure from Trump, charged the New York attorney general, Letitia James, with fraud; Trump sent national guard troops to Chicago and Portland and threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act; Trump imposed a stunning 100% tariff on all goods from China, which caused the stock market to have its worst day in six months; and Taylor Swift released her new album, The Life of a Showgirl, to \"merely mixed reviews\".\n\n\"Well those reviewers are just jealous of her talent, and of Travis Kelce's majestic redwood,\" Colbert joked, referencing Swift's cheeky song Wood.\n\nColbert celebrated some good news: on Monday, as a result of the ceasefire brokered in Gaza, all living Israeli hostages and 2,000 Palestinian prisoners were released. \"Credit where credit is due: Donald Trump did something good. Are we still canceled?\" Colbert joked, referring to his show's cancellation by CBS as the Trump administration approved its parent company's merger with Skydance Media.\n\nBut \"while Trump tries to bring peace to the Middle East, he's trying just as hard to bring war to the midwest,\" he continued, as Trump continues to send national guard troops to Chicago to support Ice.\n\n\"Personally, I am horrified to see how he's stomping on my old stomping grounds of Chicago, Illinois,\" where the comedian lived for over a decade. \"Ice has been terrorizing communities in the Windy City, going door to door, in front of elementary schools, arresting immigrants illegal or otherwise. Arresting US citizens, without any due process! Teargassing journalists who are merely reporting on what they're doing.\n\n\"All of which I know sounds bad. But before you judge them, keep in mind: they also shot a pastor in the head with pepper balls,\" he added with disgust. \"Which kinda makes you nostalgic for the earlier part of that list, doesn't it?\"\n\nAnd in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel recapped Trump's visit to Israel and Egypt to celebrate the ceasefire in Gaza. \"He finally did something positive today, and I want to give him credit for it, because I know he's not the type to take credit for himself,\" Kimmel joked.\n\n\"We're only in the first phase of what will undoubtedly be a long and tricky process,\" he continued. \"The fact is the bombing has stopped, the hostages have been released, and Trump deserves some of the praise for that. And so I know it sounds crazy to say but good work on that one, President Trump. Now maybe you can not invade Portland? Just an idea.\"\n\nKimmel also mocked Trump's \"bigly disappointment\" over not winning the Nobel peace prize that he openly campaigned for. The Norwegian Nobel committee instead awarded the prize to the Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado.\n\n\"So now Trump is focused on winning the prize next year,\" said Kimmel. \"Which is fine! Keep trying to make peace! I'm fine with coming up with prizes and trophies to motivate him. Give him the Nobel Reopen the Government and Leave Healthcare Alone prize.\"\n\nIn other news, the White House released \"results\" from Trump's latest physical. \"Good news: his blood pressure, cholesterol and genius are all stable. His doctors say he's in excellent health and fully capable of continuing to make sure that millions of his fellow Americans aren't,\" Kimmel quipped.\n\nThe White House also revealed that Trump got both the Covid and flu vaccines at his checkup. \"After all this, he got the flu vaccine, the got the Covid vaccine, he ate a whole bottle of Tylenol and he washed it down with a gallon of red dye #2, while RFK was screaming and crying and pounding on the door outside,\" Kimmel joked.\n\n\"And if you're wondering if it's hypocritical for Trump, who has denigrated these vaccines, to get them while his health officials make them more difficult for the rest of us to get, the answer is yes, it is,\" he concluded. \"It's like if we found out that Nancy Reagan was smoking crack the whole time.\"</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.6874986436631945,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Stephen Colbert\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Late Show\",\n    \"role\": \"Host\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"It's less 'we didn't start the fire' and more 'everything's on fire.'\",\n    \"message\": \"The news from the past week has been overwhelmingly chaotic and negative, resembling a widespread crisis.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Stephen Colbert\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Late Show\",\n    \"role\": \"Host\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"Well those reviewers are just jealous of her talent, and of Travis Kelce's majestic redwood,\",\n    \"message\": \"Reviewers of Taylor Swift's new album are envious of her talent and Travis Kelce's physical attributes.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Stephen Colbert\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Late Show\",\n    \"role\": \"Host\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"Credit where credit is due: Donald Trump did something good.

He will then return to the White House.\"\n\nThis is the second time since returning to the White House in January that the president has gone to Walter Reed for an exam. Last time, it included cognitive and cardiology tests. It is not clear what exactly this checkup will entail.\n\nAccording to a memo from the president's physician, Dr Sean Barbabella, Trump underwent his \"annual physical examination\" at Walter Reed on 11 April. The health report, released by the White House, declared Trump \"fully fit to execute the duties\" of the presidency. It suggested the president's \"frequent victories in golf events\" contributed to his \"excellent\" physical and mental wellbeing.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nLeavitt said Trump was \"considering going to the Middle East shortly\" after his consultation on Friday. The president had said earlier on Wednesday that he was contemplating a trip to Egypt this weekend as he sought to finalize a deal to end the two-year war in Gaza.\n\nSince his April exam, Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a condition that can cause swelling, as the president has experienced in his legs and is common in older adults. Trump's physician also addressed concern about bruising on the president's hand, attributing it to irritation caused by frequent handshaking and his use of aspirin as a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen.\n\nRecent images of a purplish bruise on Trump's hand, which appeared to have been covered with a patch of makeup, fueled online speculation that the president was ill.\n\nTrump has long been cagey about his health, and concern about the president's wellbeing stretches back to his first term.

The data is subject to a lengthy cross-checking process and likely to rise - for example, its initial report on 2023 included 143 health worker killings in Palestine, a figure which had risen to 414 by the time of their 2024 report.\n\nDeaths in Palestine, Ukraine and Lebanon accounted for a significant rise since 2023, and there have been corresponding rises in health worker arrests and attacks on health facilities. There have already been more than 1,200 attacks on health workers recorded by Insecurity Insight this year, a total expected to climb due to delayed reporting.\n\n\"Any killing of any member of nursing staff, in any context or for any reason, is entirely abhorrent,\" said Prof Nicola Ranger, general secretary and chief executive of the RCN.\n\n\"The UK government must do everything in its power to support the upholding of international law, including supporting the ICC to investigate and prosecute those responsible.\"\n\nDr Andrew Green, chair of the British Medical Association's ethics committee, said: \"When states and armed groups break international humanitarian law with attacks on the wounded and sick, health facilities and health workers, they must be held to account, and governments around the world, including our own, all have a part to play in that process.\"\n\nRanger said attacks on health systems left deep and lasting scars on communities, and placed them under immense strain as they sought to deal with widespread civilian injuries and escalating public health needs. She also called for UK overseas aid spending to be restored to 0.7% of GDP \"to support the rebuilding of devastated health systems across the globe\".\n\nThe report, Care Amongst the Chaos, includes testimony from six nurses and a midwife working in Afghanistan, Gaza, Lebanon and Myanmar.\n\nAsmaan, a nurse from Afghanistan said she and her colleagues faced intimidation and were unable to offer high-quality care.\n\n\"Most villages have no hospitals; patients die in ambulances because there is no emergency care, no oxygen, no nurses,\" she said. \"We are threatened by caretakers: 'If something happens to my child, my husband is a Taliban, and he will come after you.'

One thing's for sure: it's all about him\n\nIn this mortal existence, we all have dreams. As a child, I wanted to be an astronaut, until I found out there's no Taco Bell on the International Space Station. That's the thing about dreams: they often lead to cruel disappointment. Such is the fate of President Donald Trump, his hope of winning a Nobel peace prize dashed - not by a lack of fast food, but by common sense.\n\nThe 2025 award instead went to the Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, who was barred from running for president by her nation's courts. Machado acknowledged Trump in her acceptance of the honor, saying she appreciated his support of Venezuelan democratic reform. At least he's keeping an eye on democracy somewhere.\n\nTrump could take that as a bit of a consolation prize and focus on next year, when the effects of a burgeoning Gaza peace deal become clear. But losing is for losers, so Maga supporters are, predictably, upset about it all. Sean Davis of the Federalist declared the Nobel was actually \"beneath\" Trump and \"a joke\". If so, I wouldn't mind never hearing about it again.\n\nWhenever I'd get a C on a test, I'd mutter to myself about how grades are a construct of oppression and college isn't actually important. \"The Man\" made me go to school and read about Kant or physics or plenary authority. Like I even care about that. Not caring is a superpower in a cruel world that cares not for our feelings or our desires. Sometimes the only power we have is to withhold our interest and project indifference. When we lose a game, it's a lot easier to deny its legitimacy than to accept failure - like unplugging a PlayStation after getting blown up by a landmine in Call of Duty.\n\nThat might be the masterstroke of the modern American conservative movement. Lose an election? Must have been cheated. Finding it hard to justify the deployment of the military on American streets? The enemy is incredibly clever and is hiding. Didn't win the peace prize? Alfred Nobel must have been a cuck and a beta and a loser. Might as well unplug the PlayStation that is democracy.\n\nTrump's entire worldview seems predicated on a notion that life is unfair, the system is rigged, and he alone can balance the scales back toward justice. This all makes sense as a rhetorical strategy, and it has proved popular in an age in which most people deem the American government to be about as straight as a bowl of chicken noodle soup. But it doesn't play so well when his grievances are focused almost exclusively on himself and his own personal gripes. Indicting his enemies, trying to get late-night talkshows canceled, and whinging about an award that apparently has no value - it all starts to get rather tiresome, like your mom re-litigating that time Beverly forgot to send a thank you card after her wedding. How many times can one hear about the relatively low cost of postage before it's time to move on to a different subject?\n\nTrump's approval rating is in the dumpster. Granted, I can't remember the last time a president was consistently popular since 9/11. So maybe this is just the new normal. Or maybe lots of people are tired of hearing how one specific person is having a bad day (again) because they didn't win a medal.\n\nFrankly, I'd like to hear more about me. I'm incredibly self-absorbed (I work in the media, after all) and desperately crave approval. Where's my medal? When will my parade happen? Which head of state will subtly roll their eyes when I'm not looking? I wrote this in between power naps, and it was incredibly difficult to get up to work after the first one. When Donald Trump gives a speech, he should be addressing me directly. I have needs, too, you know? I have done nothing to earn that attention, but I'm asking for it. When mapping out domestic policy, you should be asking yourself, \"how does this affect Dave Schilling?\" \"What will Dave think of this?\" \"Can we name an aircraft carrier after someone whose father served in the air force?\"\n\nAnd if I don't get what I want, I'll say it doesn't matter.

We take them to the mud and choke them out,\" he said.\n\nEl-Sayed's fiery speech and his populist campaign in Michigan's Democratic primary for the Senate race comes on the heels of Zohran Mamdani's stunning June win in New York City's mayoral primary, which has generated momentum on the left-wing of the party.\n\nThe Sanders-endorsed, anti-establishment El-Sayed, 40, follows a similar blueprint as Mamdani, and Michigan in some ways offers favorable terrain for the leftwing populist playbook. But at the same time a repeat of Mamdani's success in the more conservative, upper midwest swing state is far from certain, and the race is viewed as a possible bellwether on leftists' electability in statewide campaigns across the US.\n\n\"This is a time when that call for new politics is resonating beyond the places one would expect it to resonate, like in the far reaches of Michigan's rural communities,\" said Yousef Rabhi, a former Michigan House Democratic floor leader who has endorsed El-Sayed. \"Abdul and Mamdani are speaking to this moment.\"\n\nLike Mamdani, El-Sayed eschews partisanship in favor of leftwing populist economic ideas, sharply criticizes Israel, and leans heavily on a sense of authenticity. In New York City, that formula resonated with younger people, activated disaffected voters and attracted support for Mamdani from across the political spectrum. Mamdani remains strongly ahead in the New York mayoral race\n\nUsing that style in Michigan is a break from the moderate Democratic politics that for decades have dominated in the state, and which defeated El-Sayed in 2018 when he lost to now governor Gretchen Whitmer in a gubernatorial Democratic primary.\n\nBut since then, El-Sayed has run health departments in Detroit and Wayne county, and touts accomplishments like helping to eliminate $700m in medical debt for local residents.\n\nThe economic playing field has also shifted since 2018, and El-Sayed thinks his message is more likely to resonate now than seven years ago. \"People now understand Donald Trump was not the cause, but the symptom,\" he said during an interview with the Guardian at a Detroit coffee shop.\n\nMoreover, Democratic voters' frustration with the party is near all time highs, and the left believes there is appetite for outsider candidates, populist economics and criticism of Israel's war in Gaza. It has boosted El-Sayed, especially in a state that's home to the uncommitted movement and large Arab-American and Muslim populations.\n\nBut there are some crucial differences between El-Sayed's and Mamdani's races.\n\nEl-Sayed's opponents are not damaged like Mamdani's main competitors, mayor Eric Adams and former New York governor Andrew Cuomo. In the August 2026 primary election, El-Sayed faces US congresswoman Haley Stevens, and state senator Mallory McMorrow. The latter is similarly young and critical of party leadership, and has styled herself as an outsider. But McMorrow largely shares the establishment's economic policy positions and brought on political insiders, like controversial former Cuomo consultant Lis Smith.\n\nEducated, middle-class voters who wanted to vote for an outsider were key to Mamdani's win. El-Sayed also needs those votes, but they may be split among him and McMorrow, even if the two candidates have substantially different policies and El-Sayed is more truly an outsider, said Josh Cohen, a progressive political analyst who writes the Ettingermentum newsletter.\n\n\"The race is not the ideal feel and circumstance in the way that New York was for Mamdani,\" Cohen said. An El-Sayed win would suggest voters are concerned with policy, he added. \"It would be a very meaningful sign that people's desire for a shift isn't superficial.\"\n\nAnother key difference between McMorrow and El-Sayed lies in Israel policy. El-Sayed calls for an end to \"blank check\" military aid to Israel and other countries, and uses the term \"genocide\". McMorrow, by contrast, has tried to walk a tightrope, calling for humanitarian relief while not using the term \"genocide\" until October.\n\nEl-Sayed's populist economic proposals include a ban on tax incentives for companies like Amazon, new taxes for billionaires, the elimination of medical debt and a strengthening of anti-monopoly laws to address corporate price gouging.\n\nThough those are leftist ideas, El-Sayed said he avoids the \"left-right\" label, which might help thread a needle in places like the rural, conservative upper peninsula. Financial pain and its cause are the same everywhere, El-Sayed added, so his focus is on the economic divide, not the cultural or political one.\n\n\"It's the divide between the people who have been locked out and those doing the locking out,\" he said. He added that his solutions have broad appeal no matter what they are labeled, and that explains why some Trump voters surprisingly show up for \"a guy named Abdul\".\n\n\"They didn't vote for Donald Trump out of a sense of hate for Muslims. They voted for him because of a sense of frustration with the way the system has locked them out,\" El-Sayed said. Indeed, the Trump-to-Mamdani voter was a key piece of the story in New York City.\n\nBut Mamdani also had built-in help from politically aligned groups who in recent years laid dow campaign and issue infrastructure that was key to his win. No such infrastructure to push these ideas exists in Michigan.\n\nEven if El-Sayed wins the primary, Republicans will try to make the general election about social wedge issues instead of economics, said Jared Abbott, a political scientist and director of the Center for Working Class Politics.\n\nMamdani and El-Sayed have so far been \"very disciplined\" in focusing on the \"working class's bread and butter economic issues\", Abbott added, and that would be essential to his overcoming GOP general election attacks.\n\nA win in the general could have an outsize impact on national politics - just as the Squad members' 2018 midterm wins reverberated into the presidential primary and Biden's domestic policy, El-Sayed's election in a swing state could help pull the 2028 presidential race and next president to the left.\n\n\"It would be a massive proof of concept that progressives do not [currently] have,\" Abbott said.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.8159304582825823,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Abdul El-Sayed\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Democratic Party\",\n    \"role\": \"US Senate candidate\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"When they go low, we don't go high.

If the past week tells us anything, it's that history will not remember Keir Starmer kindly.\n\nChina's Xi Jinping is like a boa constrictor, trying to slowly choke Britain and its Western allies. Starmer's strategy is to go limp in the hopes of saving himself.\n\nFrom the beginning, this Government's approach to China has been weak and naive. Starmer has appointed figures like Peter Mandelson and Jonathan Powell to senior positions, both with extensive links to China. He declined to block China's new super-embassy in London, while Rachel Reeves jetted off to Beijing with a begging bowl last year, in the midst of a bond market crisis.\n\nThis week's debacle over the collapse of the China spy case is the worst example yet. Starmer's Government stands accused of sabotaging the prosecution of men charged with spying in Parliament. He's alleged to have withheld the publication of a dossier which is said to expose the full extent of hostile Chinese activity against this country - cyberattacks, espionage, intellectual property theft, and even secret police stations targeting dissidents here in Britain.\n\nWe've seen the Crown Prosecution Service, the Home Office, the Attorney-General and Number 10 all briefing against one another in an effort to shift the blame and avoid the obvious conclusion: this Government engineered the case to collapse as a favour to Beijing.\n\nBy any common-sensical definition, China is an adversary of our country. The spy case only shows our enemies, including China, how weak Britain has become - and it could not come at a worse time. Since the election of President Trump, the Americans have made two things abundantly clear. First, that the Trump administration views China as an existential threat. Second, that the threat is far more advanced than initially feared.\n\nThe Pentagon's National Defense Strategy, produced in August, suggests we can expect to see less US engagement in Europe and the Middle East, as they focus on the Indo-Pacific. That is already obvious and has been a stated objective of multiple presidents, Republican and Democrat.\n\nHowever, the Trump administration is beginning to acknowledge a more uncomfortable truth. China is now so militarily advanced that it is difficult, perhaps impossible, to challenge Beijing in the medium term, even in the Indo-Pacific. America is a declining power and one that has heavily overextended itself. Reality is biting, and some in Washington, like Elbridge Colby - Trump's realist assistant defence secretary - are beginning to say so out loud.\n\nWhat's more, the American public has little appetite for foreign conflicts. From Gaza to Ukraine, Trump is in the business of settling disputes, not creating new ones. This is terrible news for Taiwan and a seismic shift for traditional allies like Japan, who have relied upon American security guarantees.\n\nThat the era of American interventionism, born in the wake of the Second World War, may be drawing to a close shouldn't come as a surprise. The Monroe Doctrine, first articulated in 1823, has seen America focus on protecting its interests in the Western hemisphere for most of its history. America's post war interventionism has been a break from this norm.\n\nYet for far too long, the European establishment has behaved as if American support could always be relied upon. That has proven to be a dangerous delusion. America devoted resources to Europe it could ill afford. In turn, Europe chronically underfunded its defence and allowed welfare states to build up which it cannot sustain.\n\nAs America withdraws, and China becomes ever more assertive, Britain must be willing to strike a new path. That doesn't mean tub thumping in the Indo-Pacific. Sending aircraft carriers on far-flung tours of duty, so we can pretend to project power in Asia, is a fantasy.\n\nBut it does mean that we must rebuild our independent military capacity, supported by a reinvigorated industrial base. Just this week, China announced new export controls on rare earth metals, weaponising critical supply chains.\n\nIt means a zero-tolerance approach to their spying and sabotage efforts, protecting our intellectual property from Chinese theft, and preventing Chinese companies from dominating strategically-significant sectors of our economy.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party respects strength and causes weakness. Weakness in the face of aggression, followed by embarrassing public rows, is the worst way to maintain relations with China. We must set and defend clear boundaries.\n\nWe've seen that this Government's approach to Beijing couldn't be more different. Starmer seems oblivious to the changing times we live in, advised as he is, by the likes of Powell and Mandelson, fossils of a different age.\n\nThe world is changing. Britain has the misfortune of a Prime Minister who seems blind to this reality. It's time for Starmer to develop a backbone and stand up to Beijing.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-60.97343444824219,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"[]"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP"}],"createTime":"2025-10-15T10:37:33.203327Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"bXnvaL-0DIaVmecPn42n2Ak","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1}],"promptTokenCount":1421,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1421}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1374,"totalTokenCount":2796,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}}}

Now the British-Nigerian vocalist preaches a message of radical positivity\n\nPlaying Glastonbury almost made Joshua Idehen quit music - twice. The first time was in 2007, when the spoken-word artist's slot followed a dancer who had successfully roused a crowd of 800. By the end of his first poem, only a handful of punters were left in the tent, even though it was pouring with rain outside. \"People were like, 'Nope, I'd rather get soaked than listen to you,'\" he says. \"That was a sucker punch.\"\n\nNearly two decades later, on the Greenpeace stage this summer, the 45-year-old faced the opposite problem. Five thousand people turned up - another \"earth-shattering\" experience, only this time a dizzying high. \"I did one Glastonbury and I was like, 'I never want to experience that again,'\" he says. \"I did the other and thought, 'It's never going to feel like this again. This might be the end.'\" He flashes a mischievous grin. \"Then I was like, 'Oh, look at how much money I can make!'\"\n\nIt's a Sunday afternoon and we're sitting in the warm, dim light of the Social bar in London, joined by Idehen's longtime Swedish producer and bandmate Ludvig Parment. In recent months Idehen has been delighting thousands at other festivals. And in a few hours, the pair will perform a show downstairs in collaboration with Love Music Hate Racism - a last-minute gig that sold out in a day.\n\nTheir energy is a stark contrast to the headlines from the previous day's \"unite the kingdom\" rally, a march of more than 100,000 people that became a hotbed of racism and hate speech as far-right protesters waved the St George's cross across the capital. When he performs later, Idehen will offer a modest antidote to the division: \"Dance is my foolproof way out of depression,\" he tells the crowd. \"Rhythm is my weapon.\"\n\nDisarming positivity is Idehen's thing. As a writer, the British-Nigerian has underground prestige, having contributed poems to critically acclaimed albums by jazz groups Sons of Kemet and the Comet Is Coming. He also published his own collection of lyrics and poems, Songbook, last year. But through his own musical project, Idehen's priority is cultivating joy.\n\nHe bellows self-help slogans (\"Choose yourself!\") over Parment's pulsating beats. He urges his audience to shake hands with strangers and \"shimmy off\" bad vibes. He dances ecstatically on stage as though alone in his kitchen. He's refreshingly earnest in his pursuit of goodness - and his insistence that the rest of us chase it too. (\"It's almost like a sermon,\" says one audience member.) Depending on how you look at it, Idehen either laughs off life's seriousness, or feels its weight so deeply he's propelled to remedy the world's collective dismay with unapologetic, sunny-side-up hope.\n\n\"My joy is a whistle / Loud in its belief that something good is coming,\" he affirms on It Always Was, a track from his forthcoming album I Know You're Hurting, Everyone Is Hurting, Everyone Is Trying, You Have Got to Try. It's a relentlessly optimistic record, full of motivational-poster lyricism spliced with jubilant soul samples and house beats. \"I wrote the lyrics for the album at a time when I genuinely did not believe we would end up where we are now politically,\" he says. \"But it was still quite bleak. We had Israel-Palestine happening, Biden was basically being Keir Starmer - just a huge, utter disappointment. I was struggling with what my purpose was.\"\n\nAs social tensions escalated at home and overseas, Idehen began to wonder if the tone of his lyrics might miss the mark. \"It was a real turmoil for me,\" he says, recalling his headspace at the start of the year. \"I kind of felt like, 'Is this not the time for something more political? Am I using my voice the right way?'\" Then he came across a clip of children dancing in a burnt-out bus in Gaza. \"If they have found joy in the midst of all that, who am I to be glum when I can actually celebrate being alive?\"\n\nParment, who often provides the calm to Idehen's effervescence, agrees. \"We struggle like everyone else, but we have a sense of purpose with this,\" he says. \"I have a lot of existential dread, but you just have to find something worthwhile to do.\"\n\nEven so, it was Idehen's most overtly political song that unexpectedly brought him so many new listeners. Released last year, Mum Does the Washing plays like a comedic glossary of political ideologies and contradictions. It starts with capitalism (\"Your mum does the washing / You pay her a dollar / You get her to do your mate's washing / Your mate pays you 50 dollars\") then escalates to hot-button subjects such as male feminism (\"That one time I did the washing / I told everybody I did the washing / I blogged about it, bragged about it / Took a selfie, Insta story / Went on TV, won an Oscar\"). At the end of each scenario, it's a woman who ends up doing the labour.\n\nTypically, Idehen writes poems to fit Parment's beats, but the busy, techno-inflected hums that accompany this track were retrofitted. The verses began as a 2015 thread on X, then Twitter, written in response to Gamergate. \"Twitter was a place of constant arguments,\" he says. This thread, he decided, could help people accurately understand words like \"fascism\" in less than 140 characters. He kept adding new lines each year - sometimes going viral - and it became a full poem, one of the works shortlisted for this year's Forward prizes for poetry. In 2024, he finally set it to music. \"We were working on an EP, and there was a particular incident that happened in a certain country - it was violent and it made me upset,\" he says, pointedly choosing his words as he navigates the Israel-Gaza conflict. He added a new line to the thread (\"Zionism: You shoved your mum / Into the washing machine / And the spinning made her dizzy / And the dizziness made her vomit / And you point at the vomit and call it antisemitism\"). \"I looked at it and said: 'Ludvig, why don't we turn it into a song?'\" By the end of the year, for the first time in his life, Idehen began to sell out gigs.\n\nHe wasn't always this engaged. Born in London and raised in Nigeria, before moving back to the UK as a young adult, Idehen admits there were times when he was on the other side of the Twitter arguments, parroting misinformed \"Black conservative talking points\" into the void. \"I used to be a sexist - I came from Nigeria, a really sexist society,\" he says. \"Even before I wrote Mum Does the Washing, I thought I was a decent person, but I didn't understand transphobia and trans activism.\" He credits the patience of friends who gently called him out with setting him straight. \"That's why I believe instances of kindness, joy and grace can make the difference. We've all done dickhead things, but we're all capable of redemption.\"\n\nIt's a simple belief, but one that feels radical in a world where the news cycle so often leaves us feeling helpless. These days, Idehen lives in Stockholm with his four-year-old daughter. \"She makes it very difficult for me to be nihilistic,\" he says, when asked whether he, too, falls victim to doomscroll defeatism. \"It's bittersweetly ironic that my career is taking off at a point where sometimes I do feel like, shit, we might be at war. Why am I making music when it all feels a bit Mad Max?\" Idehen pauses. \"I circle back to my daughter and try to imagine what kind of world I want her to live in. She has to be part of a world that's better than the one I have.\"</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.3098045236924115,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Joshua Idehen\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"Spoken-word artist, vocalist\",\n    \"nationality\": \"GBR\",\n    \"quote\": \"People were like, 'Nope, I'd rather get soaked than listen to you.'

My Jewish wife and I will utter a sigh of relief at the release of the remaining hostages and the cessation of the relentless daily waging of war. We will not, however, be listening to or watching the sickening celebrations and the adulation being claimed by those claiming credit for the peace but who played a part in perpetrating the killing.\n\nPeter Riddle\n\nWirksworth, Derbyshire\n\nWho can truly claim victory now in this devastating Israel-Gaza war? Can Hamas consider itself victorious when more than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed, including thousands of children, and much of Gaza lies in ruins after its merciless, brutal attack on Israeli civilians?\n\nIf Benjamin Netanyahu's goal was to eliminate Hamas and act in self-defence, how can the deaths of 18,457 children be justified? With Gaza destroyed and Hamas still standing, what conclusion can we draw? Either the Israeli government has failed in its objective, or the true aim was never to dismantle Hamas but rather to crush Palestinian civil life, to appease the Israeli public.\n\nThen there is Donald Trump's hubris. He supplied weapons to Israel for its destruction of Gaza, only to later call for restraint - and demand a Nobel prize for that. In the end, there are no winners here, only leaders chasing political gain at the expense of human life.\n\nDr Radhamanohar Macherla\n\nHornchurch, London\n\nThe two biggest barriers to turning a ceasefire into a permanent peace are the twin evils of blind optimism and fatalism: the assumption that success is either inevitable or impossible. That, allied to the tendency to make the perfect the enemy of the good. What it takes instead is persistence, a willingness to persist through the inevitable ups and downs of implementation.\n\nIt took nine years to go from the theory of the Good Friday agreement to the reality of Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness, as the leaders of unionism and republicanism, sitting around the same executive table - nine years to get the right sequence of arms decommissioning, demilitarisation, reform of the police and, finally, power-sharing.\n\nThe Middle East process will, no doubt, follow the same tortuous pattern, but it can succeed if the international community persists in driving it through. Palestinians and Israelis may never trust - or even like - each other, but persistence can help them do something much more important: treat each other as equals. That is the true road to a permanent peace.\n\nTom Kelly\n\nNorthern Ireland Office 1998-2001; prime minister's spokesman 2001-07</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-23.78161366780599,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP"}],"createTime":"2025-10-15T10:37:33.204606Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"bXnvaL6-DPSbmecPu6ul2Qc","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":6,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":6}],"promptTokenCount":1148,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1148}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1271,"totalTokenCount":2425,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}}}

And why shouldn't he be? After all, there is a lot to be angry about in our unpleasant world. But for Jones, one of the Left's most prominent columnists, anger is more than an emotion. It is that most sacred of things in today's society: an identity.\n\nThe impotent rage at everything he sees around him is well expressed in his columns as well as in his social media rants. Virtually every day since Hamas terrorists murdered 1200 Israelis and kidnapped 250 more, he has been fulminating against the evils of the Jewish state.\n\nNot for him the nuanced suggestion that Israel had the right to seek to destroy the Islamist psychopaths who not only carried out the attacks on October 7, but had promised endless repeats until Israel was destroyed. Not for Jones the observation that, tragically, civilians are killed in every war, something made deliberately more likely in Gaza by the terrorists' tactic of using their own people as human shields.\n\nIt's not just Gaza, of course. Jones has in the past expressed similarly bizarre levels of rage at women's attempts to exclude men from their toilets and sports; and the betrayal of the socialist cause by Keir Starmer.\n\nBut it's Gaza that motivates the Jonesian keyboard most energetically these days, and woe betide anyone who dares challenge him on any of his assertions and assumptions: the punishment for such heinous disrespect is swift and brutal.\n\nThe latest (though not the first) dispute I had with him was a couple of days ago when Jones posted a photo of himself sharing a friendly hug with Mothin Ali, the deputy leader of the Greens who has expressed admiration for the same Hamas savages who raped and murdered their way across southern Israel two years ago.\n\nTwitter user and documentary maker Malcolm Clark asked the pertinent question: \"Is the one on the left [Ali] imagining throwing the other one off a rooftop?\" Cue Jones's outrage at what he perceived as an expression of racism and Islamophobia.\n\nAnd that's when I made the mistake of seeking to defend Clark. \"Maybe it's not racism,\" I suggested. \"Maybe it's a reflection of the fact that your friend Ali has in the past expressed support for Hamas. How are we to know that, having expressed warm words for their massacre of Jews in Israel, he draws the line at their robust LGBTQIA+ policy?\"\n\nJones, of course, is one of the aforementioned alphabet people. I could imagine him reading my response and spitting an outraged mouthful of chai latte over his permanently powered-on computer screen. How dare this Telegraph columnist challenge him, seek to contradict him, ask him a clarifying question? Who did he think he was?\n\nAfter some back and forth, he invoked my employer in his vitriolic tirade, telling his followers that my hiring at the Telegraph was \"nothing to do with talent, and he knows it.\" And adding that: \"You'd get more insight from a person selected at random in a pub.\"\n\nAll of that invective seems rather disproportionate to the \"crime\" of challenging an assertion he made in a social media post. Personal insults are not, however, Owen's main weapon in his armoury. In fact he likes nothing better than promising politicians and journalists that their refusal to agree with him over Israel's alleged crimes in Gaza will see them land in The Hague answering charges of war crimes.\n\nWhat can this sort of behaviour mean?

One speaker may have several quotes.\n\nInclude direct quotes only, do not include paraphrased quotes.\n\nHere is the article:\n\n\n<article>In two years there have been many versions of a 'day after' plan for Gaza and many obstacles to overcome\n\nGeorge Mitchell, the great US advocate for the Northern Ireland peace agreement, described diplomacy as 700 days of failure and one of success. In Gaza, tragically, there have been 730 days of failure and none of success. Indeed, the destruction, the death toll and the spillover of the conflict into other countries is a monument to shame diplomacy and what remains of international law. Arguably, it is the profession's lowest point since 1939.\n\nSome will claim failure is inevitable since this conflict is now so embedded and impervious to compromise that it can only be settled at the barrel of the gun, in essence through the repression or erasure of one side.\n\nYet, however entrenched the mutual hatreds, a consensus is building across the west that this conflict was desperately mishandled, including by European leaders who initially ceded responsibility to a US Democratic administration that romanticised modern Israel, misread how its government might react to the horror of 7 October - and how that would polarise the west.\n\nIndeed, the mea culpas and self-justifications have been streaming out of Joe Biden's former team. In her book on her doomed bid to become president, Kamala Harris writes: \"I had pleaded with Joe, when he spoke publicly on this issue, to extend the same empathy he showed to the suffering of Ukrainians to the suffering of innocent Gazan civilians. But he couldn't do it: while he could passionately state 'I am a Zionist', his remarks about innocent Palestinians came off as inadequate and forced.\"\n\nShe adds that Benjamin Netanyahu never repaid the loyalty that Biden had shown because he wanted Donald Trump in the seat opposite him.\n\nAt its most generous, the Democrats misread the power dynamics. \"We did not act like a superpower,\" Andrew Miller, the former deputy assistant secretary of state for Israeli-Palestinian affairs, recently said. \"Instead of beginning from the proposition that these were problems we could solve, we persuaded ourselves that there was little we could do to move our regional ally Israel.\"\n\nTrump did not have that inferiority complex. He used his unpredictability as his greatest diplomatic weapon but, like Biden, his special envoy Steve Witkoff became bogged down in trying to find a formula that guaranteed the release of all the hostages without Israel resuming the fighting, as it did in March this year.\n\nAs successive variations of Witkoff proposals emerged, France and Saudi Arabia took matters into their own hands, deciding to use a UN conference on a two-state solution as a vehicle for gripping the diplomacy in a different way. The US monopoly on the peace process was broken and the neglected issue of Palestinian self-rule was finally addressed.\n\nBefore the conference, initially due to be held in June but delayed by a month by Israel's attack on Iran, Emmanuel Macron extracted a letter from the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, that endorsed a plan for the day after a ceasefire under which Hamas would be disarmed and debarred from holding office and a transitional body of experts would be formed to govern Palestine \"under the umbrella\" of a reformed Palestinian Authority (PA). The notion of reform of the PA, often an empty diplomatic vessel, was this time given specifics, including a commitment by Abbas to much-delayed elections and internal change. An international force would be introduced.\n\nMany versions of the \"day after\" plan for Gaza had been circulating since 2024 - one by American and Israeli experts published by the Wilson Center, another drafted by the Rand Corporation, a set of principles issued by the United Arab Emirates and a plan from Egypt. The Saudi-French plan incorporated many of these ideas into what became the New York declaration, passed by the UN conference in July and endorsed by the UN general assembly in September, with Israel and the US voting against.\n\nOne European diplomat said: \"Although there was a lot of media heat about the issue of recognising Palestinian statehood, that was not where the serious diplomatic breakthrough was. We managed to convince the Americans to link the commitments to the ceasefire to a plan for what happens afterwards - and to realise that focusing on a ceasefire on its own would not work.\"\n\nIn reference to America's over-reliance on Israeli firepower to impose its will, the diplomat said: \"We also convinced them they could not go on rolling the dice and thinking it will come up double six.\"\n\nCritical to the process was a meeting in the White House in late August where Jared Kushner, Tony Blair and Witkoff convinced Trump that mass expulsions of Palestinians from Gaza was neither necessary nor wise.\n\nOne of those present said: \"Trump had no illusions about Netanyahu's reliability and had invested in the Middle East states. He was persuaded that for states such as Jordan and Egypt the spectre of waves of Palestinian refugees spilling over their borders was a red line. Trump agreed to take mass enforced displacement off the agenda.\"\n\nThe other big message out of the meeting was that for the first time it became feasible to try to merge White House and French thinking. Speaking at Harvard University last month, the French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, said: \"President Trump asked some of his close advisers to go to the Arab countries, to go to France, to go to the UK, to gather all the ideas that all of us have been putting together for months and years for what a day after plan would look like.\"\n\nThe aim of the two-state solution conference and the general assembly vote, Barrot said, was to remove the obstacles to the two-state solution, including by Arab states condemning the 7 October attacks and endorsing the declaration's exclusion of Hamas from Gaza.\n\n\"Until that vote, there was no international condemnation of Hamas, no international call for its disarmament, no international goal for its exclusion from any future role in the governance of Gaza and Palestine,\" Barrot said. \"This is done. We have changed the mindset. Everyone now sees Hamas for what they are: a terrorist organisation.\"\n\nThe second obstacle, he explained, was to overcome Arab governments' reluctance to state publicly that they had a goal of establishing diplomatic relations with Israel.\n\nBarrot said the new UN text went further than ever before. \"We got them ... to say that they aspire not only to have a normal relationship with Israel, but to enter into a common regional architecture in the model of Asean in Asia or OSCE in Europe,\" he said. \"We got them to say things they never said.\"\n\nSo, contrary to appearance, the weeks and days leading up to the general assembly was about the Arab states reaching out to Israel. Far from being rewarded, Hamas, an opponent of a two-state solution, was being ostracised from political power in Palestine, a fate its battered leadership has reluctantly accepted.\n\nBut for Israel the New York declaration, with its clear references to a Palestinian state and a role for a reformed Palestinian Authority, remained unacceptable. So when Trump revealed his plan to the Arab and Muslim states on the sidelines of the general assembly, the declaration had become the benchmark against which it was to be judged by the Arab and Muslim states.\n\nThe Trump plan, largely prepared by Blair and Kushner, was necessarily thin, ambiguous and stripped of a timetable. The Arab states had misgivings, but advocates such as Blair argued that if the plan was more specific it would lose the required broad support and critical momentum. The lack of immediate leaks delighted western diplomats since it suggested the Arab states thought they could work with the plan.\n\nBut while the Arab states left New York, Netanyahu stayed in New York, holding two lengthy weekend meetings with Witkoff. After Israel's attack on Hamas negotiators in Qatar on 9 September - a personal betrayal of Witkoff and Qatar - Netanyahu was persona non grata in the White House. Yet the Israeli prime minister extracted further concessions.\n\nThe amnesty to Hamas members was only available to those who handed over weapons in front of international observers and committed to peaceful coexistence. More detail was added about the destruction of Hamas infrastructure. Moreover, the withdrawal of IDF forces was blurred, and by the end the IDF would have to withdraw only to a security buffer zone encompassing more than 17% of Gaza until the strip \"is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat\".\n\nThe process for this withdrawal \"will be carried out according to criteria, and with a timeframe, to be agreed upon between the IDF, the international stabilisation force, the guarantors and the United States.\"\n\nAfter the plan's publication, Netanyahu in a video message assured his domestic audience that Israel's red lines were protected: Gaza separated from the West Bank, no return by the PA to Gaza, no path toward a \"two-state solution\" and no removal of Israel security forces from the majority of the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn trying to assuage the extremists in his coalition, Netanyahu was also doing all he could to persuade Hamas to reject the plan, so he could pursue the military offensive into Gaza City.\n\nEven though the plan did not have a timeline for when the board of technocrats would hand power to an elected Palestinian government, Qatar, Turkey and Egypt urged Hamas to accept many of the unsatisfactory ambiguities that could be addressed later. The war would end.\n\nDiplomats said this message was received best not by the Hamas political wing in Doha but by the Hamas fighters inside Gaza, a new younger cadre steeped in the sacrifices made. With wording crafted by Qatar, the Hamas answer was in effect a \"yes, but\" that was open to many interpretations. Trump, to Netanyahu's utter dismay, chose to take the Hamas response as an unqualified \"yes\". The key was that Hamas was willing to relinquish its greatest bargaining chip: the remaining hostages.\n\nTahani Mustafa, of the European Council on Foreign Relations, argues that since the 7 October attack Palestinians politics has shifted to a more transactional outlook. \"Palestinians are looking to someone that can make life bearable, keep them on their land and improve their living conditions. The very bare minimum is what people are asking for. Most Palestinians on the ground have resigned themselves to their fate.\"\n\nOn this basis, the technocratic body to be chaired by Trump, but likely to be dominated by Blair with some figures from the Palestinian diaspora, could derive its legitimacy through its effectiveness.\n\nBlair will be working against the destabilising backdrop of imminent elections in both Israel and Palestine. One of the body's first tasks will be to build a relationship with Palestinian politics. Blair has close relations with the elites of the Middle East but none with the street, and he may leave to others such as Egypt the task of mediating an intra-Palestinian dialogue on Palestinian unity, a dialogue led by China, that the ageing and authoritarian PA president has sought to sabotage.\n\nIf elections do occur as promised, it could produce a change. The last time elections were attempted, in 2021 in the West Bank, the democratic appetite was there with 36 lists formed outside the established factions. The key question is what will happen if the elections produce a result that Blair's technocratic board do not like.\n\nAs the Gaza war has continued with ever worsening devastation, Israel's reputation has been shattered. In the Arab world, Israel is now seen as a greater threat to security than Iran. In the global south it is likened to apartheid South Africa, and across Europe the demonstrations and accusations of genocide continue. Growing majorities of American Jews and Democrats disapprove of Israel's actions.\n\nRobert Malley, a US negotiator at the time of the Oslo accords, has just co-authored a book on the impossibility of rational diplomatic answers to the conflict. He said external would-be peacemakers had been \"so focused on whether we can get them to agree on what it would mean if there was a Palestinian state, just words on a piece of paper, without coming to terms with the nature of this conflict, the nature of this beast - which was a historical clash of narratives.\n\n\"From the Israeli perspective, they won in 1948. They won in 1967. And the Palestinians believe that they were victims of a historic injustice in 1948, 700,000 Palestinians expelled, loss of their land.\n\n\"And so for us Americans to come in and say, 'well, let's just paper over these differences, forget about the right of return, forget about Israeli historic grievances and Palestinian historic grievances, put a bow around it and call this peace' - that was never going to fly with the parties.\"</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.40876611447801775,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Kamala Harris\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"I had pleaded with Joe, when he spoke publicly on this issue, to extend the same empathy he showed to the suffering of Ukrainians to the suffering of innocent Gazan civilians.

Yet analysts believe the change in public opinion to be so fundamental as to represent a permanent shift.\n\nSignificantly, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) - for years the most influential pro-Israel lobby group, which has organized primary challenges and boasted of unseating members of Congress deemed too critical or unsupportive - has shown signs of diminishing influence, as senior Democrats reportedly break longstanding ties.\n\nThe seismic shift is even more pronounced among the wider public.\n\nA Pew Research Center survey last week reported that nearly six out of 10 Americans, 59%, now hold a negative view of Israel, while 39% believe it is \"going too far\" in its war in Gaza - compared with 31% who held the same view a year ago, and 27% who thought this just two months after the war started. A poll from the same organization in 2022 showed 42% with negative views.\n\nThe anti-Israel swing is confirmed by other polls. A recent New York Times/Siena poll showed pro-Palestinians sympathies outscoring support for Israel - albeit narrowly, by 35% to 34%.\n\nAn Economist/You Gov poll in August found that 45% of the public believe Israel is committing genocide - a charge Israel vociferously denies - compared with only 31% who disagreed. About four in 10 American Jews believe the same, according to a new Washington Post poll.\n\nThe change has been more acute among Democrats, where support for Israel is declining among all voter groups - with potentially profound implications for future elections and US foreign policy.\n\n\"A debate is brewing among Democrats that is certain to appear in the Democratic presidential primaries, and it will not be a comfortable debate within the party,\" said Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and co-author of a recent report on Israel's eroding support.\n\n\"If the next president is a Democrat, there will be a mix of views represented in the White House, and that itself will have an impact on governance,\" he continued.\n\nThe shift has propelled upstart candidates who have publicly identified themselves with the Palestinian cause. The most notable has been Zohran Mamdani, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist who triumphed in a Democratic primary to become the party's candidate for New York mayor after championing Palestinian rights.\n\nAnother is El-Sayed, in his campaign to be the party's Senate candidate in Michigan, a traditional election swing state and home to a significant bloc of Arab American voters who swung in significant numbers to support Donald Trump in last November's presidential election because of disenchantment with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris's support for Israel's Gaza offensive.\n\nEl-Sayed, a former public health official, said his campaign had revealed an altered view of the conflict irrespective of background.\n\n\"I've gone to a lot of communities where there are no Arab or Muslim residents and when I when I talk about this issue, there's a collective sigh of relief,\" he said in an interview.\n\n\"People think, 'Finally there's a politician who's willing to name the obvious ... our tax dollars are being sent abroad to do unspeakable things instead of investing here at home.'\n\n\"Over the past few years, we've watched as life has become more unaffordable. People are struggling to afford everything from groceries to gas to healthcare, watching their schools crumble.\n\n\"So the idea that our tax dollars that could be used to invest in our children here at home are instead being used to destroy other children is beyond the pale for a lot of folks.\"\n\nRepublicans are encountering their own version of skepticism over support for Israel.\n\nWhile voters over 50, according to the Brookings study, remain staunchly supportive of Israel, a drift has been discernible among younger Republicans, many of whom see unconditional backing for Israel as clashing with Donald Trump's commitments to avoid foreign entanglements.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene, the hard-right member of Congress from Georgia, made headlines in July by labelling Israel's actions in Gaza \"genocide\", several weeks before Bernie Sanders, the progressive senator from Vermont, did the same.\n\nTrump has taken note. Talking to the Daily Caller in September, the president - who last week unveiled a plan for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, standing alongside the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu - said Israel had lost political influence in Washington.\n\n\"Israel was the strongest lobby I've ever seen. They had total control over Congress, and now they don't,\" he said.\n\nGrowing restiveness among his Maga base may have spurred Trump into trying to end the war with greater urgency, although the results remain to be seen.\n\nSome supporters say the disenchantment is generational.\n\nCurtis Mills, executive director of the American Conservative, a magazine originally founded to oppose the US-led invasion of Iraq, and which has long railed against the US alliance with Israel, said Trump's presidency could be \"the last baby boomer, conservative, extremely Zionist-inclined administration\".\n\n\"The US has been involved in foreign policy adventures at the behest of the Israeli cause for decades, and it hasn't worked for the United States - it's worked for Benjamin Netanyahu,\" he said. \"For people under 40, 30, or even 20, when it's the Middle East, again, again, again, the gag reflex is going into full effect. And I think it's becoming bipartisan.\"\n\nHe continued: \"The average age of a congressman is in the mid-60s, so this is not going to be expressed in legislative power today or even in the next Congress. But for under-50s, I think the Israel issue is dead on arrival.\n\n\"It is unlikely that the [next] Republican [presidential] candidate will be nearly as pro-Israel as previous Republican candidates have been.\"\n\nFor now, the clearest signs of a sea change may be in Washington, where Aipac - long the dominant pro-Israel lobby group - is losing ground to traditionally smaller organisations.\n\nThe New York Times reported that Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, had accepted the endorsement of J Street, a center-left group that has criticised Netanyahu's government and favors a two-state solution to the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict.\n\n\"For a long time, Aipac was the biggest kid on the block,\" said Galston, of the Brookings Institution. \"It will be a more equal fight in the next cycle.\"\n\nMarshall Wittmann, Aipac's spokesman, cited a Senate vote in July defeating a motion backed by Sanders seeking to halt US arms sales to Israel as proof that Congress remains pro-Israel. While senators voted against the resolution to block the sale of assault rifles, a majority of Democrats present in the chamber, voted in favour.\n\n\"Polls fluctuate, but the reality is that Israel is fighting a just and moral war against a barbaric enemy that savagely attacked the Jewish state on October 7 and continues to hold 48 hostages,\" he wrote in an email. \"It is entirely consistent with American interests and values to stand with a democratic ally as it battles Hamas and other Iranian terrorist proxies.\"\n\nBut Galston predicted that future policymakers would not see Israel in same David-and-Goliath image that once shaped the US view.\n\n\"Joe Biden will surely be the last [Democratic] president whose views were shaped by the early years of Israel, its astonishing victory in 1967 [in the six-day war], and by the fact that Israel was a beleaguered underdog for decades,\" he said.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.44192840028337843,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Abdul El-Sayed\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Democratic Party\",\n    \"role\": \"Candidate for US Senate in Michigan\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"There's no doubt that there's been a change.

I hope they draw strength from each other\n\nIt's amazing how much of my life has been shaped by Crumpsall when I think about it. Which I hadn't until last Thursday, and the horrific attack on the Heaton Park synagogue. Crumpsall is a small area of north Manchester, 1.2 sq miles with a population of 18,000. When I became seriously ill at the age of nine I was initially taken to Crumpsall hospital. When I finally went back to a special school two years later, it was Crumpsall Open Air; when I went to synagogue, it was Higher Crumpsall.\n\nFor many years, I took Crumpsall for granted at best, or dismissed it. It was associated with some of the most painful parts of my life (illness) and my least favourite (religion). I preferred to talk about Cheetham Hill, less than two miles away, because it seemed cooler and more secular, though in reality it was often impossible to separate the two neighbouring areas. Ironically, and stupidly, I also preferred Cheetham Hill because it seemed more street; more dangerous.\n\nI moved away from Manchester to university in Leeds and then to London decades ago. My parents continued living in a middle-class Jewish suburb called Broughton Park, within a mile of where they had both grown up. It seemed suffocatingly insular to me. And then when my sister and I moved away, they downsized to a home a couple of roads away. When Dad died nearly 20 years ago, Mum stayed there in her tiny house in her tiny close.\n\nFor a long time I couldn't bear going there. It felt so claustrophobic, physically and socially. I always wondered why she stayed there. However much I loved her (and believe me I adored her), I was snobbish about where she lived, and thought she deserved a bigger, better world. She was a fish out of water in the close - an observant but largely secular Jew (if that's not a contradiction) living among a largely Hassidic community. The area had become more and more religious over the decades - or as we Jews called it, frummer and frummer.\n\nBut what did I know about smallness and insularity? In the final few years of Mum's life, I spent more and more time in the house, both with her and without her. When she was in hospital with various ailments, I often stayed there alone while visiting her. And when she was back home recovering, I stayed there because I wanted to be with her.\n\nI began to love both the house and the community. Or should I say communities. In the decades I'd been away, more and more Muslims had moved into Crumpsall and Cheetham Hill. They did not displace Jews, they lived largely separate lives, peacefully side by side. It wasn't just different religions, it was different degrees of religion. So ultra-frum Jews lived along frum and not-so Orthodox Jews, and likewise ultra-frum Muslims lived alongside frum and not-so frum Muslims. Rainbows within rainbows. Far from being the shtetl that my parents' generation thought it was, Crumpsall/Cheetham Hill was fantastically, cinematically diverse. (It really would be a wonderful location for a movie.)\n\nOf the 18,000 people who live in Crumpsall, just under 10,000 are Muslim, 1,000 are Jewish and 4,000 are Christian. In the 2021 census, 0.5% of the English and Welsh population identified as Jewish, while 6.5% identified as Muslim. So both the Jewish and Muslims populations of Crumpsall are roughly 10 times the national average. Alongside the 4,600 residents born in the Middle East and Asia (roughly 25%), more than 1,000 came from Africa. Affluent areas bordered on some of the most impoverished in the country.\n\nThere's a Tesco about five minutes' walk away from Mum's old house. It's huge and I've never seen a supermarket that caters for so many cultures. Mum used to wonder why I spent so much time there, or wandering along Cheetham Hill. I told her I found it inspirational - all classes, religions and races going about their business under the one grey sky. I couldn't get over my belated discovery - that the place I'd dismissed as parochial was one of the greatest melting pots on the planet.\n\nAnd, four days after the terror attack, it still is. While politicians and men of God and populist journalists try to sow division in Crumpsall, while they tell us that the attack was an inevitable result of the British government's recognition of Palestine as a state, or its refusal to clamp down on demonstrations about the genocide in Gaza, or its failure to police synagogues, it's important to remember that this grotesque attack was an outlier. It was the actions of a single man (though others have been arrested in connection with the incident), not one community waging war on another as some would have us believe.\n\nCrumpsall was, and is, a model community. To an extent, the suburb is its own peaceful two-state solution in miniature. And it's just had a horrible but temporary setback. These are terrifying times for Jews and Muslims in Crumpsall and the world at large. Manchester responded to the Arena terror murders of 2017 in the best possible way - a colony of defiant bees united in its common humanity. Love trumped hate hands down. It must do so again for Crumpsall.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-14.160139719645182,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP"}],"createTime":"2025-10-15T10:37:33.224789Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"bXnvaJXcDdmXmecP3ISXmAw","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":6,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":6}],"promptTokenCount":1610,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1610}],"thoughtsTokenCount":322,"totalTokenCount":1938,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}}}

The funding will be delivered through Unicef, the World Food Programme and the Norwegian Refugee Council.\n\nThe UK will also host a three-day conference organised by the Foreign Office's Wilton Park agency, based in West Sussex, beginning on Monday afternoon.\n\nThe event will include representatives from the Palestinian Authority as well as Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Germany and Italy.

Keir Starmer will be in Egypt today, attending the Middle East peace summit being co-chaired by Donald Trump. The PM will be a minor figure in a huge global story, and Yohannes Lowe is covering it all on our Middle East live blog.\n\nAt Westminster MPs are returning to the Commons after the four-week conference recess where the news here won't be making global headlines. But, in a curious twist, a tweet from Steve Witkoff, President Trump's peace envoy, has managed to link Gaza with the main talking point in Westminster politics this morning.\n\nAbout two hours ago Witkoff posted this on X.\n\nI would like to acknowledge the vital role of the United Kingdom in assisting and coordinating efforts that have led us to this historic day in Israel. In particular, I want to recognize the incredible input and tireless efforts of National Security Advisor Jonathan Powell.\n\nThis seemed to be a response to what Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador to Israel, posted on X yesterday in a comment on a video clip of Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, saying in a Sunday morning interview that the UK had played a key role behind the scenes in shaping the peace deal announced by Trump. Huckabee, a Trump/Netanyahu loyalist who has been scathing in public before about the Labour government's foreign policy, said:\n\nI assure you she's delusional. She can thank @realDonaldTrump anytime just to set the record straight.\n\nThe Witkoff tweet read like an White House-sanctioned mini rebuke, and a reassurance to London that the ambassador was not speaking on behalf of the administration.\n\nBut Witkoff's decision to also go public with lavish praise for Powell also implies that he is trying to be helpful to the UK national security adviser when he is under intense pressure because the opposition parties are blaming him for the collapse of the China spy trial. Here is Peter Walker's overnight story on this.\n\nPowell is under increasing pressure because, with recess over, MPs can now use all the parliamentary levers available to them to demand a fuller explanation from ministers as to what happened. They can table urgent questions, or even use the SO24 (standing order 24) procedure to demand an emergency debate. Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, was furious about the decision to drop the spying prosecution (because it involved allegations of spying happening within parliament) and he is likely to be sympathetic to requests for UQs or emergency debates. When ministers know that a UQ is likely to be granted, they often decide to make a formal ministerial statement instead.\n\nThis is what Hamish Falconer, the Middle East minister, implied would happen in a Today programme interview this morning. Asked if the public would get a proper explanation in parliament as to why the spy trial collapsed, he replied:\n\nI will not get ahead of the speaker on what it was tabled in parliament, but I would expect that parliaments will discuss this later.\n\nFalconer was referring to the fact that the Speaker's Office only formally announces what statements and UQs are being allowed at about 1pm on a Monday.\n\nPowell is being blamed for the collapse of the trail because it is alleged he refused to agree to the government giving the prosecution a statement saying China is a threat to national security, and that without this the prosecution could not make this case. It is alleged Powell wanted to hold back to avoid antagonise the Chinese government.\n\nMinisters say the decision to drop the case was taken by the Crown Prosecution Service, not the government, and that they were constrained by what official government policy was at the time the alleged offences were committed - when the last government was in power.\n\nIn his Today interview Falconer offered a slightly new version of this argument, saying the Official Secrets Act should be been updated sooner. He said:\n\nThere was a case taken about alleged offences under the Official Secrets Act, which is a rather archaic piece of legislation ... which was written in 1911.\n\nThe case, unfortunately involves a period before successor legislation was put in place in 2023 [the National Security Act].\n\nSo the CPS, who do these things, rightly, independently from government, were trying to put together a case based on evidence from both a period where the Official Secrets Act, rather than National Security Act was the legislation in place, and it was this Conservative government, rather than the Labour government, who were in place.\n\n10.30am: Kate Forbes, Scotland's deputy first minister, opens the final day of the SNP's conference in Aberdeen. John Swinney, the first minister, winds up the conference with a speech at 3.05pm.\n\n11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing.\n\n12.30pm (UK time): Keir Starmer is due to meet President Trump at the Middle East peace summit in Sharm el-Sheikh that Trump is co-chairing with the Egyptian president, Abdel Fattah\n\n2.30pm: Steve Reed, the housing secretary, takes questions in the Commons.\n\nAfter 3.30pm: There are likely to be several urgent questions and ministerial statements, including one on the collapse of the China spy trial.\n\nIf you want to contact me, please post a message below the line when comments are open (normally between 10am and 3pm BST at the moment), or message me on social media.

Entire families have been wiped out in a single airstrike. Sometimes, only a single individual, frequently a child, is left alive. There are also nearly 170,000 injured.

Thousands of people have simply disappeared - lost, incinerated or blown apart by explosions, or held in secret detention by Israel.\n\nIsrael has controlled and restricted supplies going into Gaza throughout the conflict but imposed a total blockade of supplies from March to May 2025, saying that Hamas was stealing assistance to pay for its military operations. Though restrictions were eventually eased amid international outrage, famine was declared in parts of Gaza in August.\n\nThe impact of Israel's offensive on Gaza has led to accusations of genocide, which Israel has denied. In September, independent experts working for the UN high commissioner for human rights said that the death toll and destruction in Gaza met its criteria for a genocide. This, too, was challenged by Israel.\n\nThe war, triggered by a Hamas raid into Israel on 7 October 2023 which killed approximately 1,200 people and took a further 251 as hostages, has devastated Gaza, in physical and human terms. Almost all Palestinians in the territory have been displaced, usually many times. Entire cities have been reduced to dust and broken concrete. Witnesses of attacks, or victims of the violence around some food distribution sites, or medics in overwhelmed hospitals describe \"post-apocalyptic landscapes\" or \"hell on earth\".\n\nMore than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed inside Gaza by Israeli attacks. Most are civilians. At least 20,000 are children - about 2% of Gaza's child population.\n\nMore than 168,000 have been wounded, many suffering injuries of a type and scale more usually associated with professional soldiers in intense combat, according to one recent medical study.\n\nMany other Palestinians have been killed by hunger, lack of shelter and medication, accidents, the rapid spread of infectious diseases and the collapse of the healthcare system. Life expectancy in Gaza may have decreased by up to a half in the first year of the conflict, according to a study in the respected medical journal the Lancet.\n\nIsraeli officials have previously questioned the death toll given by the authorities in Gaza, saying that because Hamas controls the government there, Gaza's health officials cannot provide reliable figures.\n\nBut in September the former Israeli army commander Herzi Halevi said more than 200,000 Palestinians had been killed or injured in the war in Gaza . Leaked Israeli military intelligence data on casualties until May this year suggested that more than 80% of the dead were civilians. \"This isn't a gentle war. We took the gloves off from the first minute,\" Halevi said.\n\n436,000\n\nHomes damaged or destroyed (92% of total)\n\n2.1 million\n\nPalestinians displaced in Gaza (95% of the population)\n\nIsrael's campaign of intense aerial bombing and deliberate tactic of razing territory its troops have seized has led to 78% of Gaza's estimated 250,000 buildings being damaged or destroyed, generating 61m tonnes of debris, of which about 15% may be contaminated with asbestos, industrial waste or heavy metals.\n\nMore than 80% of Gaza's territory is estimated to be currently under an Israeli military evacuation order or combat zone, or otherwise barred to Palestinians. Most recently, the Israeli offensive into Gaza City, where large numbers of those displaced from elsewhere were sheltering, forced hundreds of thousands to flee.\n\nIn all, aid agencies estimate that about 2.1 million people have been displaced, 95% of the population. \"This is a traumatic, violent process, often repeated again and again. There are people who have lost absolutely everything,\" said James Elder of Unicef last week.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people now live in tent cities and severely overcrowded shelters with poor sanitation and access to little clean water, including in al-Mawasi in the south.\n\nCurrently, 1 million people cannot access six litres of drinking water a day, while 500,000 people exist on less than nine litres, just over a tenth of what was available before the war.\n\nMedieval mosques, Ottoman-era markets, churches and ancient sites have all suffered massive damage or been entirely destroyed.\n\n518\n\nSchools damaged or destroyed (90% of schools)\n\n745,000\n\nChildren and university-age students out of formal education\n\nSince October 2023, 745,000 students in Gaza have been out of school for more than two academic years, including 88,000 higher education students who have been forced to put their studies on hold.\n\nGaza's educational infrastructure has been more or less destroyed: more than 90% of school buildings, 79% of higher education campuses and 60% of vocational training centres have been damaged or destroyed.\n\nSchools run by the Unrwa agency have been converted into emergency shelters. They host large numbers of displaced people and are clearly marked on maps, but many have been bombed by Israel, with some targeted repeatedly.\n\nIsrael says strikes targeted Hamas fighters, claiming they shelter in the buildings and use civilian residents as human shields.\n\n654\n\nAttacks on healthcare facilities during the war\n\nMore than 1,700\n\nHealth workers killed\n\nAs of last month, just 14 of Gaza's 36 hospitals were even partly functional. Sixteen field hospitals in southern Gaza set up by NGOs and foreign governments provide some replacement care, but these and remaining facilities are often overwhelmed. Bed occupancy reached 240% capacity in al-Shifa hospital and 300% at al-Ahli hospital, both in northern Gaza, medics there reported in late September.\n\nAlmost all hospitals have sustained some damage from Israeli strikes and one was entirely demolished by the Israeli military. The World Health Organization reported 735 attacks by Israeli forces on healthcare in Gaza from 7 October 2023 to 11 June 2025, killing 917 people and injuring 1,411. Medics and paramedics were killed, injured, detained and tortured by Israeli forces.\n\nMedical officials in Gaza said Israel's restrictions on medicine entering Gaza meant that many essential treatments were unavailable and equipment unusable, leaving them even less prepared to deal with those injured in the war, or suffering from diseases caused or compounded by lack of shelter, food and clean water.\n\n400\n\nMalnutrition-related deaths\n\nAccording to the UN, 400 malnutrition-related deaths, including those of 101 children, have been documented since the beginning of the conflict, most in recent months. Tens of thousands of children are now on emergency feeding programmes. In August, UN-backed experts declared a famine in parts of Gaza. Aid workers said in October that most pregnant mothers in Gaza were eating one meal a day.\n\nIsrael has imposed tight restrictions on aid entering Gaza throughout the conflict, and its destruction of agricultural production inside the territory has led to scarcity. Any improvement during the brief ceasefire from January to March, when restrictions were lifted, was reversed when Israel unilaterally resumed hostilities and blocked all supplies for two months until, in mid-May, controls were eased again.\n\nThe controversial Israel-and US- backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation was set up to hand out food, but this led to more than a thousand deaths under Israeli fire. Much aid delivered into Gaza has been looted by gangs and desperate, hungry crowds. The produce and goods now available in markets is unaffordable for most of the population.\n\nIsrael says it does not limit aid shipments and blamed logistics failures at aid agencies, or Hamas theft of food aid, for any shortages.\n\n1.5%\n\nProportion of Gaza cropland that can be farmed\n\nSince 2023, the Gaza Strip has lost 97% of its tree crops, 95% of its shrubland and 82% of its annual crops, making food production at scale impossible. The destruction will have long-term impacts on ecosystems, biodiversity, food security and the health of residents, ecologists and academics say.\n\nIn August, new UN figures showed that only 1.5% of cropland is accessible and suitable for cultivation. Toxic residue from munitions and fires have polluted the soil and water supplies.\n\nSince October 2023, Mine Action partners have documented 132 explosive ordnance incidents that killed 47 people, including at least 14 children, and injured 249 people, including at least 71 children.\n\n\"The situation is going from bad to worse, if this continues, it will leave a legacy of environmental destruction that could affect the health and wellbeing of generations of Gaza residents,\" said a United Nations report last week.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.142330242756226,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Herzi Halevi\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Israeli Army\",\n    \"role\": \"former Commander\",\n    \"nationality\": \"ISR\",\n    \"quote\": \"This isn't a gentle war.

There were isolated protests during the sport's other two grand tours, the Giro d'Italia and Tour de France.\n\nIsrael-Premier Tech announced on Monday that it would be rebranding the team, adding that Adams would be relinquishing his current duties. \"With steadfast commitment to our riders, staff, and valued partners, the decision has been made to rename and rebrand the team, moving away from its current Israeli identity,\" it said in a statement.\n\n\"In sport, progress often requires sacrifice, and this step is essential to securing the future of the team. Looking ahead to the 2026 season, Sylvan Adams has chosen to step back from his day-to-day involvement and will no longer speak on behalf of the team, instead focusing on his role as President of the World Jewish Congress, Israel.\"\n\nOne of the team's sponsors, the UK-based Factor Bikes, had said its support was conditional on disassociating from Israel. Another sponsor, the Canadian-based manufacturer and horticulture firm Premier Tech, had taken a similar stance, saying it expected that Israel-Premier Tech would \"evolve to a new name excluding the term Israel, and that it will adopt a new identity and a new brand image\".\n\nAlthough the scrappy end to the Vuelta in Madrid was criticised by rightwing Spanish politicians, the country's socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, praised those who had protested peacefully.\n\nSánchez said he had \"a deep admiration and respect\" for the cyclists in the Vuelta and for \"a Spanish society that mobilises against injustice and defends its ideas in a peaceful manner\".</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.5339466441761364,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Benjamin Netanyahu\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Government of Israel\",\n    \"role\": \"Israeli prime minister\",\n    \"nationality\": \"ISR\",\n    \"quote\": \"Great job to Sylvan and Israel's cycling team for not giving in to hatred and intimidation.

On Thursday, Starmer signed a defence deal worth £350m for UK missiles, manufactured in Northern Ireland, to be used by the Indian army.\n\n\"Our history together is deep, the human connections between our people are truly special,\" Starmer said as he left Mumbai. \"Building on our historic trade deal, we are remaking this partnership for our times.\"\n\nStarmer has spent time in Mumbai studying the Indian digital ID system, including meeting key figures who designed the widespread system used by more than 1 billion people for benefits, payments and identification.\n\nThe prime minister hinted that the UK was interested in broadening the scope of digital ID beyond making it mandatory to prove rights to work. He suggested the UK would eventually look at linking it to banking and payments systems - on a voluntary basis - as well as for administrative tasks such as mortgage and school applications.\n\n\"It's been taken up on a voluntary basis [in India] in huge numbers, not least because it means that you can access your own money, make payments so much more easily than is available with others,\" he said.\n\n\"The speed with which it allows citizens here to access services, particularly financial services, is something that was recognised in our discussions yesterday, and actually a Fintech discussion that we had today as well. So we're looking at those examples of how digital ID helps individuals with the processes that sometimes take too long and are too cumbersome and makes them easier for them.\"\n\nStarmer acknowledged the government had to make the case for the reforms to the British public, which have plummeted in popularity since Starmer announced them.\n\n\"I think now we need to go out and make that case of the huge benefits ... And I think that the more people see the benefits that come with this ... as has happened in other countries, people say: 'That will make my life easier,' and therefore I want to get on with it,\" he said.\n\nStarmer has been welcomed to India with thousands of posters of himself plastered across the main streets and motorways of Mumbai. When he appeared on stage at a conference, Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister, addressed him as his friend and praised him for having unblocked the trade deal.\n\nStarmer said he had raised a number of difficult topics with the Indian premier regarding human rights and relations with Russia, though he appeared to have made little headway. Starmer confirmed that he and Modi discussed how India was continuing to buy Russian oil, which is subject to widespread western sanctions.\n\n\"For prime minister Modi and myself the focus on ending this conflict and the various steps will be taken to that end,\" he said. \"And that was a wide range of discussion, but we did set out the steps that we are taking in relation to energy.\"\n\nStarmer also said he had raised the case of the British Sikh activist Jagtar Singh Johal, from Dumbarton, who has been held in an Indian jail for nearly eight years without facing full trial. It is often cited as one of the worst examples of injustice among Britons still held abroad.\n\nBut Starmer did not suggest much progress had been made. \"Yes, we did raise the consular cases,\" he said. \"We always raise them when we have the opportunity to do so. I should say that the foreign secretary is meeting the families in coming weeks, as well as raising it today.\"\n\nThe prime minister is widely expected to take a similar trade-focused trip to China in the coming year as part of a mission to ease relations between the UK and China.\n\nThat relationship is under the spotlight because of the collapse of a Chinese spying case, said to have happened because the UK has been unwilling to provide fresh evidence that China is considered a threat.\n\nStarmer said the UK was keen to pursue other trading relationships but said a trade deal with China was not on the agenda. \"That's not on our list, for a trade deal as such, but our position is to cooperate where we can, challenge where we must, and that's been the consistent policy of the government in relation to China.\"</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.20298354156015677,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Keir Starmer\",\n    \"organisation\": \"UK Government\",\n    \"role\": \"Prime Minister\",\n    \"nationality\": \"GBR\",\n    \"quote\": \"would not have happened without President Trump's leadership\",\n    \"message\": \"The Gaza ceasefire agreement could not have been achieved without President Trump's leadership.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Keir Starmer\",\n    \"organisation\": \"UK Government\",\n    \"role\": \"Prime Minister\",\n    \"nationality\": \"GBR\",\n    \"quote\": \"must now be implemented in full, without delay, and accompanied by the immediate lifting of all restrictions on life-saving humanitarian aid to Gaza\",\n    \"message\": \"The ceasefire agreement must be fully implemented immediately, and all restrictions on humanitarian aid to Gaza must be lifted without delay.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Keir Starmer\",\n    \"organisation\": \"UK Government\",\n    \"role\": \"Prime Minister\",\n    \"nationality\": \"GBR\",\n    \"quote\": \"What matters now is to press on and implement this ... my focus now is moving this from the stage it's at now ... and make a success of this, because that matters to me more than anything else\",\n    \"message\": \"The priority is to proceed with implementing the agreement and ensuring its success, as this is of paramount importance.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Keir Starmer\",\n    \"organisation\": \"UK Government\",\n    \"role\": \"Prime Minister\",\n    \"nationality\": \"GBR\",\n    \"quote\": \"Our history together is deep, the human connections between our people are truly special\",\n    \"message\": \"The UK and India share a profound history and exceptionally strong human connections.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Keir Starmer\",\n    \"organisation\": \"UK Government\",\n    \"role\": \"Prime Minister\",\n    \"nationality\": \"GBR\",\n    \"quote\": \"Building on our historic trade deal, we are remaking this partnership for our times.\",\n    \"message\": \"The partnership between the UK and India is being reshaped for the current era, leveraging their historical trade agreement.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Keir Starmer\",\n    \"organisation\": \"UK Government\",\n    \"role\": \"Prime Minister\",\n    \"nationality\": \"GBR\",\n    \"quote\": \"It's been taken up on a voluntary basis [in India] in huge numbers, not least because it means that you can access your own money, make payments so much more easily than is available with others\",\n    \"message\": \"The digital ID system in India has been widely adopted voluntarily, primarily because it simplifies accessing personal finances and making payments compared to other methods.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Keir Starmer\",\n    \"organisation\": \"UK Government\",\n    \"role\": \"Prime Minister\",\n    \"nationality\": \"GBR\",\n    \"quote\": \"The speed with which it allows citizens here to access services, particularly financial services, is something that was recognised in our discussions yesterday, and actually a Fintech discussion that we had today as well.

Then Rubio passed the president a note.\n\nNews photographers covering the event zoomed in on the handwriting on White House stationery that read: \"You need to approve a Truth Social post soon so you can announce deal first.\"\n\n\"I was just given a note by the secretary of state saying that we're very close to a deal on the Middle East, and they're gonna need me pretty quickly,\" Trump said. \"So we'll take a couple of more questions.\"\n\nThe event had already been going on for more than an hour when Rubio first approached. The president invited him to come in, and Rubio whispered something to Trump before handing him the note.\n\nThe note's urgent tone came as Trump's top Middle East adviser, Steve Witkoff, Qatari PM Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and other senior officials joined a third day of peace talks between Israel and Hamas at an Egyptian resort - a sign that negotiators aim to dive deeply into the toughest issues of a US plan to end the war in Gaza.\n\nTrump had kicked off the influencer event by telling assembled journalists that he planned to travel to the Middle East \"toward the end of the week\" and could even \"make the rounds\" in the region to Egypt and possibly Gaza as US negotiators closed in on a deal.\n\nStill, even after Rubio passed Trump the note, Trump continued to talk to the influencers and take questions from the media as the secretary of state became visibly anxious.\n\nNearly 10 minutes after his initial comments about leaving, Trump said: \"I have to go now to try and solve some problems in the Middle East - although I'm very well represented by our secretary of state. He could probably do an even better job than me, but who knows.\"\n\n\"We don't want to take any chances. So we're going to go and do that,\" Trump added.\n\nHe then suggested Pam Bondi and Kristi Noem stay and take questions in his absence. However, Trump continued to take questions before the event finally broke up without Cabinet members remaining behind.\n\n\"We're gonna get peace in the Middle East,\" Trump wrapped by saying. \"That's what we want to do.\"</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.033547516120521,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Marco Rubio\",\n    \"organisation\": \"United States government\",\n    \"role\": \"Secretary of State\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"You need to approve a Truth Social post soon so you can announce deal first.\",\n    \"message\": \"The President needs to approve a Truth Social post soon to announce a deal first.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Donald Trump\",\n    \"organisation\": \"United States government\",\n    \"role\": \"President of the United States\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"I was just given a note by the secretary of state saying that we're very close to a deal on the Middle East, and they're gonna need me pretty quickly.\",\n    \"message\": \"The President has received a note from the Secretary of State indicating that a Middle East deal is very close and his presence will be required soon.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Donald Trump\",\n    \"organisation\": \"United States government\",\n    \"role\": \"President of the United States\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"So we'll take a couple of more questions.\",\n    \"message\": \"The President will answer a few more questions.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Donald Trump\",\n    \"organisation\": \"United States government\",\n    \"role\": \"President of the United States\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"I have to go now to try and solve some problems in the Middle East - although I'm very well represented by our secretary of state.

And now I carry those voices with me into the heart of the UN\n\nIn its 80th year, the UN headquarters in New York heard speeches that made headlines. One leader thundered threats of war. Another complained about an escalator. Meanwhile, outside the polished floors and gilded halls, children were starving in Palestine. Bombs fell. Borders closed. Budget cuts placed the very architecture of human rights under siege.\n\nThis was meant to be a landmark gathering, a celebration of 80 years of multilateralism. Instead, it felt like a reckoning. Can the UN still serve the people it was built to protect, or has its promise begun to crack under the weight of politics?\n\nI am 22. I am not a politician. I am not a diplomat. I arrive without motorcade, without flags, without fanfare. But I carry something infinitely heavier: the voices of young people crying out for basic recognition - the ones who should be standing in these chambers, yet perhaps never will.\n\nFor the past year, I have travelled across this country, leading one of Australia's largest ever face-to-face youth consultations. From the Tiwi Islands to Tasmania, from city classrooms to remote detention centres, from town camps to refugee programs, I have listened to thousands of young people. And now I carry those voices with me into the heart of the UN, which is currently still in general assembly proceedings, negotiations and debates.\n\nAnd as I traveled Australia's 7.7m square kilometres, time and again, I was asked: \"What is the purpose of the UN?\"\n\nThis is the same question US president Donald Trump posed to the general assembly this year - but while his interrogation came from a hostile place, the question I heard came from the cries of children drowning in poverty. From families forced to choose between a child's medicine and their own survival. From those terrorised by law enforcement. From young people trapped in modern slavery, sold into forced marriages, robbed of any hope for a future. From those who live every day with the silent weight of exclusion, of neglect, of invisibility.\n\nThese children live at the sharpest edge of society, where survival is not a given. Ten-year-olds locked in detention longer than they've ever known a home. Children ripped from family, from culture, from everything that should keep them safe. Young people go hungry, scrape by in poverty, watch their dreams wither under debt and neglect - all while the world looks away.\n\nSo I started collecting letters. Thousands of them - to the prime minister, to Australia and to the world. From prisons, classrooms, foster homes, communities on Country, across every corner of the nation.\n\nFrom a youth detention centre, a 16-year-old boy wrote of being beaten, starved and denied his mother, begging for housing and a future beyond the walls. From Alice Springs, a 14-year-old boy wrote that crime is not a choice but survival for kids whose homes aren't safe. And from Christmas Island, a 16-year-old girl described the trauma of boats being turned around and refugee families brutally locked away.\n\nThese are the voices that should shake the walls of the United Nations; not handshakes for the media, not empty speeches.\n\nI write this as an Australian - but this is really about all of us.\n\nFrom the youth in Alice Springs who commit crimes just to survive to the children in Gaza who beg for bread and safety. From refugee families trapped on Christmas Island to the voices of displaced children across Lebanon and Jordan's camps. From the hopelessness of a child in an Australian detention centre to the kids forced into armies in Sudan or trafficked across borders in south-east Asia.\n\nThe struggles of young people are borderless.\n\nWalking the corridors of the UN, surrounded by history and power, I feel the weight of both worlds: the spectacle of photo-ops, and the unforgiving reality of lives breaking outside these walls.\n\nI believe the UN still has a vital role, but only if it truly hears the cries of the forgotten: refugees who never made it home, survivors of modern slavery rebuilding their lives, people with disabilities left without care, Indigenous families robbed of land and language, Pacific Islands and small nations drowning in the rising tide of climate disaster, those behind bars and the voiceless.

As a matter of fact, the ACA made health insurance UNAFFORDABLE for my family after it was passed, with skyrocketing premiums higher than our house payment.\"\n\nGreene, an adherent to the Make America great again (Maga) movement that has resulted in two presidencies for Donald Trump, said she was prepared to stand against her party on the issue. Republicans maintain that Democrats must allow the government to re-open before they will discuss healthcare concessions.\n\nGreene made it a point to say that she has not changed her mind about opposing free healthcare to immigrants in the US without legal status - although, as Democratic House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries said recently in an interview with ABC News, \"federal law prohibits the use of Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program and the Affordable Care Act to provide health insurance in any way, shape or form to undocumented immigrants\".\n\nThe one big beautiful act passed earlier during Trump's second presidency, meanwhile, ended the eligibility of many types of lawfully present immigrants to access federally funded health coverage for private health insurance.\n\n\"I'm not towing the party line on this, or playing loyalty games,\" Greene said. \"I'm a Republican and won't vote for illegals to have any tax payer funded healthcare or benefits. I'm AMERICA ONLY!!!\"\n\nGreene also criticized members of her party for failing to find a solution or prioritize that issue over funding for the Ukraine-Russia war as well as Israel's war in Gaza.\n\n\"All our country does is fund foreign countries and foreign wars, and never does anything to help the American people!!!\" she added. \"It is absolutely shameful, disgusting, and traitorous, that our laws and policies screw the American people so much that the government is shut down right now fighting over basic issues like this.\"\n\nGreene's turn comes as Trump signaled a possible opening for a deal with Democrats, before appearing to walk it back.\n\n\"If we made the right deal, I'd make a deal - sure,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday. But Trump later posted on social media that he is happy to work with Democrats on any issue \"but first they must allow our government to re-open\".</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.33274497956742227,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Marjorie Taylor Greene\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Republican Party\",\n    \"role\": \"Congresswoman\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"absolutely disgusted\",\n    \"message\": \"I am absolutely disgusted that insurance premiums could double if tax credits are allowed to expire.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Marjorie Taylor Greene\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Republican Party\",\n    \"role\": \"Congresswoman\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"Let's just say as nicely as possible, I'm not a fan.\",\n    \"message\": \"I am not a fan of the Affordable Care Act.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Marjorie Taylor Greene\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Republican Party\",\n    \"role\": \"Congresswoman\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"But I'm going to go against everyone on this issue because when the tax credits expire this year my own adult children's insurance premiums for 2026 are going to DOUBLE, along with all the wonderful families and hard-working people in my district.\",\n    \"message\": \"I am going to oppose others on the issue of expiring tax credits because my adult children's insurance premiums will double in 2026, as will those of many families and hard-working people in my district.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Marjorie Taylor Greene\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Republican Party\",\n    \"role\": \"Congresswoman\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"I was not in Congress when all this Obamacare, 'Affordable Care Act' bullshit started.\",\n    \"message\": \"I was not a member of Congress when the Affordable Care Act was initiated.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Marjorie Taylor Greene\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Republican Party\",\n    \"role\": \"Congresswoman\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"I got here in 2021.\",\n    \"message\": \"I became a member of Congress in 2021.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Marjorie Taylor Greene\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Republican Party\",\n    \"role\": \"Congresswoman\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"As a matter of fact, the ACA made health insurance UNAFFORDABLE for my family after it was passed, with skyrocketing premiums higher than our house payment.\",\n    \"message\": \"The Affordable Care Act made health insurance unaffordable for my family after its passage, with premiums becoming higher than our house payment.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Hakeem Jeffries\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Democratic Party\",\n    \"role\": \"House Minority Leader\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"federal law prohibits the use of Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program and the Affordable Care Act to provide health insurance in any way, shape or form to undocumented immigrants\",\n    \"message\": \"Federal law prohibits the use of Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program, and the Affordable Care Act to provide health insurance to undocumented immigrants.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Marjorie Taylor Greene\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Republican Party\",\n    \"role\": \"Congresswoman\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"I'm not towing the party line on this, or playing loyalty games.\",\n    \"message\": \"I am not adhering to the party's stance or engaging in loyalty politics on this matter.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Marjorie Taylor Greene\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Republican Party\",\n    \"role\": \"Congresswoman\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"I'm a Republican and won't vote for illegals to have any tax payer funded healthcare or benefits.

But the government faces tougher battles if it wants to create a fairer Australia, writes Tom McIlroy. We have a detailed explainer on the changes.\n\nTony Abbott's new book, Australia: A History is reviewed by Frank Bongiorno, who warns that the former prime minister's upbeat assessment of the convict era might give the impression that it was like a \"holiday camp\". The book is a mostly celebratory account of a land \"built by heroes\", and it is \"very good in places\". But Abbott also savages old enemies and concludes that we have to take more pride in our British heritage and drop climate and identity politics.\n\nVictoria's new police chief has promised a shake-up of the force and plans to get more officers on the street, the Age reports.

In agreeing to a deal with political backing from Arab states and other regional powers, this is the best chance for an end to the war since a ceasefire broke down in March returning Gaza to a grinding war that has left nearly 68,000 dead, most of them civilians.\n\nSince March there have been rumblings of a deal but nothing that has come this close. The first phase of the peace plan, as Trump called it in a Truth Social post on Wednesday, is straightforward: the return of hostages held by Hamas in exchange for a limited withdrawal by the Israeli military. But locating all the hostages, and managing an Israeli withdrawal, could be complicated.\n\nIn keeping with the tone of Trump's presidency, hopes are expressed in hyperbole, with the president saying \"ALL of the Hostages will be released very soon, and Israel will withdraw their Troops to an agreed upon line as the first steps toward a Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace. All Parties will be treated fairly!\"\n\nThere is so much left to be discussed. The 20-point peace plan proposed by the administration attempts to thread the needle between creating the conditions for a ceasefire and negotiating a lasting end to the war; the hard questions of Hamas' future and whether the militant group will disarm, along with Israel's vision for the future of Gaza, remain to be hammered out.\n\nAnd we have been here before: the Trump administration was in a hurry to negotiate an end to the Gaza war even before the inauguration, and a hastily organised ceasefire in January broke down over the sequencing of the release of the hostages still held in Gaza.\n\nAnd yet, this is a crucial moment. As the US president spoke at an anti-Antifa roundtable on Wednesday afternoon, he was handed a note by the secretary of state Marco Rubio: \"Very close. We need you to approve a Truth Social post soon so you can announce deal first.\"\n\nNobody said that Israel's war in Gaza had to end with Oslo-style peace accords or political deliberations.\n\nThis is a very different moment - an openly partisan and flighty US president, who nonetheless has wielded his unpredictability to keep both his allies and enemies off-balance. Trump is also said to be motivated by a desire to see himself as the first US president given the Nobel Peace Prize since Barack Obama.\n\nThat prize is set to be delivered on Friday, and the desire to give the US president a win has driven political considerations in Washington and throughout the Middle East.\n\nThe remaining tensions are clear. In a statement, Hamas called on Trump and other parties to \"ensure that the Israeli occupation government fully complies with the terms of the agreement\". The fear is that Israel may resume its offensive once it has returned its hostages.\n\n\"We will never abandon our people's national rights until freedom, independence, and self-determination are achieved,\" the group said, referring obliquely to a desire for Palestinian statehood that has been rejected by Netanyahu and largely abandoned by the White House as well.\n\nNetanyahu, too, has political considerations to deal with. On Thursday, he said, he will \"convene the government to approve the agreement and bring all our dear hostages home.\" He must manage the response from the rightwing members of his government, including finance minister Bezalel Smotrich and national security Itamar Ben-Gvir, who have threatened to topple the government in case of a ceasefire.\n\nTrump has attempted to overcome those considerations by brute force, threatening \"all hell\" would break out in Gaza against Hamas in case his desire for peace was not reached. When Netanyahu expressed doubt about the deal, he told the Israeli leader: \"I don't know why you're always so fucking negative ... This is a win. Take it,\" according to Axios.\n\nThe US president is said to be planning to travel to the region this weekend for the signing of a deal. This is his moment, and it may require all of his personal brand and influence to prevent yet another breakdown of talks and a return to the fighting in what would be a diplomatic defeat for his administration.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.80872685546875,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Donald Trump\",\n    \"organisation\": \"President of the United States\",\n    \"role\": \"President\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"ALL of the Hostages will be released very soon, and Israel will withdraw their Troops to an agreed upon line as the first steps toward a Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace.

The militant group holds 48 hostages, 20 of which are believed to be alive.\n\nAn international taskforce will work on finding the remains of hostages not released on Monday, many of which are believed to be buried under the rubble somewhere in the devastated Gaza Strip.\n\nIsrael will also release nearly 2,000 Palestinian detainees, the vast majority of which will be sent to Gaza or exiled to neighbouring countries, though the timing of their release has not yet been specified.\n\nUS president Donald Trump will visit Jerusalem on Monday to speak at the Knesset roughly at the same time as the hostage-detainee swap, as well as meet with families of the hostages.\n\nTrump will then fly to Sharm el-Sheikh where he will co-chair a \"peace summit\" attended by the leaders of more than 20 countries aimed at finalising a permanent truce in Gaza.\n\nThough the path ahead for the deal was murky, Trump said he expected a ceasefire would continue. \"They're all tired of the fighting,\" the US president told reporters at the White House, adding that there was a \"consensus\" on the way forward.\n\nThe hostage-detainee swap is the first step in Trump's 20-point plan to end the war in Gaza. A ceasefire has been in place in Gaza since Friday afternoon, but most of the details of the Trump plan need to be negotiated before a lasting end to the war is established.\n\nPalestinians were desperate to see the ceasefire extend into a permanent end to the ceasefire, after two years of an Israeli campaign which destroyed most of the strip, killed more than 67,000 Palestinians and wounded about 170,000. Israel stands accused of conducting genocide in Gaza by a UN commission of inquiry and several human rights bodies.\n\nIsrael denies the claim of genocide and says its conduct in the war, launched in retaliation for an attack by Hamas-led militants that killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostage, constitutes self-defence.\n\nIn Israel, preparations were under way to receive the hostages, who will be taken to a military base to undergo an examination before being taken to hospitals, which have run drills to prepare for the hostage release, using actors in place of hostages to practise.\n\n\"We are very excited, waiting for our son and for all the 48 hostages,\" Hagai Angrest, whose son Matan is among the 20 hostages still held in Gaza, told Reuters.\n\nOn Sunday night, tens of thousands of people cheered in 'hostages square' in Tel Aviv as US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff spoke, alongside Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\n\"I dreamed of this night. It's been a long journey,\" Witkoff said. The crowd yelled praise for Trump, but booed when Witkoff mentioned Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nFamilies in the occupied West Bank also prepared to receive loved ones who were being let out of Israeli jails. Israeli authorities instructed families not to be vocal in their celebrations and warned them to limit their interaction with the media.\n\nRoughly 2,000 Palestinian detainees were due to be let out around the same time as hostages were released. About 1,700 were detainees from Gaza, while 250 were longtime prisoners of Israel, among them Palestinian leaders. About half of the 250 were to be released to Gaza or exiled to neighbouring countries, while the other half would be released to the West Bank or East Jerusalem.\n\nAs preparations continued for the hostage swap, humanitarian groups geared up to send aid into Gaza.\n\nCOGAT, the Israeli military agency which oversees humanitarian aid in Gaza, said that it expected about 600 trucks to enter the strip each day, starting on Sunday. This would restore aid to around prewar levels, after months of severely restricted aid into the strip.\n\nThe UN said that about 170,000 metric tons of food, medicine and other humanitarian aid is ready to enter Gaza once Israel permits its entry. Tents, high-energy-food for malnourished children and menstrual hygiene supplies were among the prioritised aid items.\n\nThe restoration aid into the territory comes after months of Israeli siege on Gaza, which resulted in famine in parts of the territory, according to the world's leading authority on food crises. Starvation has spread through the territory since May, with at least 459 people dying of hunger over the past two years.\n\nThe restoration of regular aid into the territory is mandated by the Trump plan. The UN will once again coordinate aid into Gaza after months of being barred by Israel from doing so.\n\nThe role of the private Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which was meant to replace the UN in aid distribution in Gaza, remained unclear. The foundation's aid distribution sites in Gaza had stopped operating after the ceasefire deal started.\n\nThe GHF was widely seen as a failure, its model of aid distribution marked by overcrowding and death. More than 1,000 were shot to death by Israeli soldiers during the daily scramble to access aid at the GHF sites, chaos which aid groups said was brought on the foundation's militarised model of aid provision. The GHF consistently denied any wrongdoing.\n\nThe US would also deploy up to 200 troops in Israel to help establish a taskforce to assist with stabilisation efforts in Gaza.

One speaker may have several quotes.\n\nInclude direct quotes only, do not include paraphrased quotes.\n\nHere is the article:\n\n\n<article>Donald Trump's proposals are in play, but here in the West Bank we live in fear that the devastation of Gaza is coming our way\n\nBeing an eternal optimist, I hoped that the events of 7 October 2023 - Hamas's attack on southern Israel and breaking of the Israeli siege of Gaza - might precipitate a reappraisal of Israeli strategy towards the Palestinians. I hoped Israeli leaders would come to realise the futility of protecting their country by building walls, however impregnable.\n\nInstead, the attack did the opposite. It led to a war of revenge that has now lasted for close to two years, killing more than 65,000 Palestinians and causing the widespread devastation of Gaza, including destroying 92% of its residential buildings. Initially, I was shocked by this, and the dehumanisation of the people of Gaza which immediately came from Israeli leaders - Yoav Gallant, who was defence minister at the time of the attack, justified the war by declaring: \"We are fighting human animals and are acting accordingly.\"\n\nI should not have been surprised. For many years, the army has been using similar tactics and language against Palestinians. In April 1983, the Israeli army chief of staff Rafael Eitan likened Palestinians in the West Bank to \"drugged cockroaches in a bottle\". Throughout the years of Israeli occupation, house demolitions have also been used as a supposed deterrence as well as shooting innocent people caught in army raids. The walls and checkpoints restricting contact between Israelis and Palestinians pushed the two sides further apart, making it possible to demonise each other even further. Even the ethnic cleansing which Israel is attempting in Gaza is not without precedent. In the 1948 Palestine war, more than 700,000 Palestinian Arabs were expelled or fled from their homes, and Israel's military carried out dozens of massacres targeting them.\n\nYet the intensity of the atrocities committed by the Israeli army in Gaza since 7 October has been on a different scale to anything that has happened previously. On the West Bank, we have no previous experience of what it would mean to live next to a state committing genocide against our people and the widespread tolerance of the Israeli people of these actions. We watch in horror what is taking place in Gaza, and also with trepidation. We wonder when our turn will come for the kind of attacks from the air that Gaza has been subjected to.\n\nConfined as we are by hundreds of checkpoints and gates to our small enclave of Ramallah, we have been subjected to repeated attacks by Israeli settlers and the army inside the city itself, which, according to the Oslo accords of 1995, is supposed to be under the full control of the Palestinian Authority and its security force.\n\nIt is a constant source of pain to witness more of our land being colonised. The hills around Ramallah are becoming more militarised, with settlers' outposts being built on high grounds and masked settlers brandishing machine guns roaming the hills, ready to attack anyone daring to take a walk. The sense of danger when venturing to these areas has been heightened.\n\nIn August this year, the head of the Israeli army's central command, Avi Bluth, ordered the felling of around 3,000 olive trees in the village of Al-Mughayyir, in Ramallah, which would have soon been ripe for the autumn harvest. For decades the Israeli military has uprooted olive trees - an important cultural symbol and source of income for Palestinians. The justification for this felling was the claim that the trees posed a \"security threat\" to a main Israeli settlement road that runs through the village lands. And this week, with the start of the olive-picking season, settler attacks are beginning - as happened last Friday in the village of Farkha south-west of the city of Salfit.\n\nSoldiers also imposed a siege on Al-Mughayyir and stormed homes there. Bluth explained: \"The first mission is to hunt [the assailant] ... The second is to carry out shaping operations here, and to ensure that everyone is deterred - not only this village, but every village that tries to raise a hand against the residents [settlers].\"\n\nIn the past, when confronted with such human rights violations our hope was that we could win some reprieve through the efforts of Al-Haq, the organisation I helped establish 45 years ago. I could never have imagined that it would be sanctioned and prevented from providing the services to our community. We Palestinian have always expected disproportionate repression to our efforts to secure our rights. But the brazenness of this move, combined with its dramatic implications for those in Europe and the United States standing with us, should be a wake-up call for everyone.\n\nI never expected that it would be destroyed by none other than the one-time champion of human rights, the United States of America. It had long been an ambition of mine that the organisation would find a route to prosecuting Israel for its violations. I could not have predicted that helping the international criminal court would be deemed a fatal offence .\n\nIn August, the Israeli government gave final approval for the controversial E1 extension of a settlement project which would effectively fragment Palestinian lands, link thousands of illegal settlements in occupied East Jerusalem to the Ma'ale Adumim settlement bloc, and undermine the viability of a future Palestinian state by ending any chance of a contiguous Palestinian territory.\n\nThe international community's response has been mixed. Citizens in European countries are realising that, should Israel continue to get away with its repeated infringement of international law, this would contribute to the destruction of the rules-based world order. This has motivated many protest groups to indicate their opposition to Israel's policies against Palestinians. Most recently, hundreds of activists from 44 countries were intercepted on the Freedom Flotilla after setting sail with the intention of breaking the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip and delivering aid. However, even with more citizens taking action, their governments remain lethargic, pronouncing tepid criticism of Israel's actions while continuing to support the state's war effort.\n\nYet, despite this disappointing institutional response, the war in Gaza has led to significant changes in the way Israel is perceived worldwide. The fact that the country came into being through the violent displacement of Palestinians in the 1948 Nakba has become better understood. So many misconceptions about Israel's foundation propagated over the past 77 years are being exposed. This has also led to a significant shift in willingness to platform Palestinian voices in spaces which were closed to them in the past.\n\nFollowing Donald Trump's proposed \"Gaza peace plan\", Hamas has approved the release of all \"prisoners of the occupation\" and signalled its \"readiness to enter into negotiations\". Consequently, Trump has ordered Israel to immediately stop bombing Gaza. If the war were to end and the siege on Gaza were to be lifted, Palestinians have the expertise to rebuild their country. They have the engineers, workers and technicians with decades of experience of working under siege. If they are given access to machinery they could rebuild faster than any external contractor.\n\nThere is no doubt about the Israeli army's fighting capabilities. But Israel must choose between perpetual war or living in peace. This can only happen if the country recognises Palestinian self-determination - a prospect that, at present, seems remote. At the culmination of this war, Israel might end up destroying Gaza, but it will also destroy itself.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.7243225356828888,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Yoav Gallant\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Israeli Ministry of Defense\",\n    \"role\": \"Defence Minister\",\n    \"nationality\": \"ISR\",\n    \"quote\": \"We are fighting human animals and are acting accordingly.\",\n    \"message\": \"The Israeli Defence Minister stated that the Israeli military is fighting human animals and will act accordingly in its operations.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Rafael Eitan\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Israeli Army\",\n    \"role\": \"Chief of Staff\",\n    \"nationality\": \"ISR\",\n    \"quote\": \"drugged cockroaches in a bottle\",\n    \"message\": \"The Israeli Army Chief of Staff likened Palestinians in the West Bank to drugged cockroaches in a bottle.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Avi Bluth\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Israeli Army's Central Command\",\n    \"role\": \"Head of Central Command\",\n    \"nationality\": \"ISR\",\n    \"quote\": \"The first mission is to hunt [the assailant] ...

Though he left the city just a few weeks ago, he could no longerrecognise its streets. The buildings he had grown up in between had collapsed, their contents carpeting the roads in a mixture of torn furniture and broken concrete.\n\nAl-Kurdi could only recognise the Netzarim checkpoint marking his entry into north Gaza by the bodies lying at its feet - those who had tried to return home too early, their faces obscured by dust after being cut down by Israeli fire.\n\n\"The city looks completely different, as if it is no longer the Gaza we once knew. In just a short time, massive destruction has spread everywhere. Almost all of the houses are destroyed, the streets blocked,\" said al-Kurdi, a 40-year-old resident of Gaza City, as he returned to his home in the Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood.\n\nAl-Kurdi was one of the thousands of people of Gaza who took advantage of the ceasefire announced on Friday to travel back to their homes in northern Gaza. Videos showed a coastal highway clogged with crowds , many on foot, making their way northwards.\n\nFor the first time since a previous ceasefire had collapsed in mid-March, fighting had stopped in Gaza. Hamas and Israel had agreed to stop fighting to prepare for the release of 48 Israeli hostages held in Gaza and nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners in an agreement that is meant to lead to a complete end to the two-year war.\n\nLike most people of north Gaza, Al-Kurdi was filled with anxiety as he walked north. In the days leading up to the ceasefire, Israel had been intensely bombing Gaza City as part of its campaign to occupy the city.\n\nAl-Kurdi had no idea if his home was among the lucky few that was still standing.\n\n\"I expect to find a ghost city. Some neighbours went ahead of me and told me the situation in the neighbourhood is catastrophic. They said my house was badly damaged by drone strikes, but is still standing,\" he said. Even if his house was uninhabitable, he hoped to at least salvage some of his belongings.\n\nThe journey north was not easy, as transportation was overwhelmed by the hundreds of thousands of people who wanted to return home. Those who headed north described walking for hours with Israeli drones flying overhead, and hearing explosions in the distance.\n\n\"I slept in the street for two days waiting for permission to pass through the [Netzarim] checkpoint and return home. There were no vehicles available so I hung on to the back of my neighbour's car for three hours until we arrived safely,\" said Ahmad Salem, a 30-year-old from al-Jabalia in northern Gaza.\n\nThough a ceasefire was in effect, Israeli troops were still present in about half of the Gaza Strip. Approaching them could spell death, an Israeli military spokesperson said shortly after the ceasefire was announced, specifying specific areas that were still off limits.\n\nDespite her home town of Beit Lahia being one of the areas that the Israeli army said was still forbidden to enter, Asmaa Zuheir decided to make the journey back anyway. Even if she could not reach her home, she was hoping to at least catch a glimpse of her neighbourhood from afar.\n\n\"I managed to reach the outskirts of Beit Lahia but could not move toward the centre because of the danger still present. Drones started firing at anyone who advanced toward the city,\" said Zuheir, a 34-year-old nurse.\n\nFrom her vantage point on the outskirts of Beit Lahia, she could only see bare earth; the entire area had been flattened by bulldozers.\n\n\"I saw no landmarks. The entire area had been levelled to the ground. There was not even rubble left from the houses,\" said Zuheir.\n\nZuheir did not dare stay too long, leaving as the crowds of people began to thin. Though she had not managed to reach her home, she began to walk back, stopping along the way to collect some tree branches to make a fire to keep warm once night fell.\n\nSalem had managed to reach his home, only to find that it no longer existed. He added his home to the long list of things he had lost over the last two years, unimportant compared to the loss of his brother.\n\nStill, despite losing his house, Salem still felt he had returned home.\n\n\"Here in the north, despite all the devastation, I feel more at peace than in the south, because I am back where I belong, to my memories, my neighbourhood, my neighbours, and my home, even if it is destroyed,\" he said.\n\nIt is unclear how long the ceasefire in Gaza will last. The head of Hamas's negotiating team, Khalil al-Hayya, said in a video address on Thursday that he had received guarantees from the US and other international powers that the ceasefire will hold. But negotiators still had to agree on thorny issues such as the disarmament of Hamas and the makeup of a governing body for Hamas.\n\nResidents of Gaza had been here before - a ceasefire had ended in mid-March when Israel unilaterally decided to resume fighting - and so were eager to return home while they still could.\n\nDespite the destruction they found upon their return, many hoped that the days ahead held a respite from the brutality of the past two years. Amid the mounds of rubble, small scenes of joy still unfolded.\n\n\"On the road, I saw someone returning. When he saw his house still standing from a distance, he began to run and shout with joy,\" said Zuheir. \"At that moment, I felt pain because I was returning to my area knowing my house was already completely destroyed.\"\n\n\"People here, when they see any trace of their house, feel great hope and joy, as if it had never been damaged. All they want is a small piece of their memories from the house they once lived in,\" she added.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.5826979838144619,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Abdel Fattah al-Kurdi\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"Resident\",\n    \"nationality\": \"\",\n    \"quote\": \"The city looks completely different, as if it is no longer the Gaza we once knew.

But there is no guarantee that the ceasefire will end Palestinian suffering\n\nThe reprieve brought by the end of fighting in Gaza is immense. In Israel, the release of the living hostages has led to widespread elation. In Gaza and the West Bank there are also celebrations, as up to 2,000 Palestinian detainees start to be released - though there is distress, too, due to uncertainty about who is being freed and where they will be sent. In northern Gaza, people can finally return to dig through rubble for the remains of an estimated 10,000 missing people.\n\nAs recently as three weeks ago, the likelihood of a ceasefire appeared remote. But it has taken effect, and on Monday Donald Trump travelled from Jerusalem, where he was cheered in the Knesset, to Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt. There, he joined a high-powered peace summit of more than 20 world leaders, including Sir Keir Starmer. The plan for peace begun there is due to be continued at a conference in the UK. The US president, acting with international partners, did make this deal happen - despite, not because of, Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nHopes that the deal marks the first step toward Palestinian statehood are understandable - but, given historical precedent, somewhat optimistic. It offers no clear path to sovereignty for Palestinians and risks splitting, for the foreseeable future, Gaza from the West Bank. Then there is the utter devastation this war leaves behind. The lack of any timeline for Palestinian self-determination in Mr Trump's plan gives the lie to vainglorious references, in his Knesset speech, to the \"historic dawn\" of a \"golden age\".\n\nThe US president could not help himself polarising and personalising the deal in his speech. In a moment of relief - with the hostage release, ceasefire and resumption of aid - he chose to recast it as a morality play in which he alone restored Israel's honour after supposed betrayal by former US presidents Obama and Biden. This despite the Biden administration a year ago having attempted a similar deal: a ceasefire tied to humanitarian access and eventual political talks.\n\nA plan that denies one side meaningful agency cannot yield legitimate peace. The ceasefire and aid trucks are to be welcomed. But this is not yet political progress. Without mechanisms guaranteeing Palestinian participation and control over their own institutions, any deal risks freezing subjugation under the language of peace.\n\nGaza's people desperately need humanitarian aid - and food and medicines must be the first priority. But reconstruction cannot wait. Amid 60m tonnes of rubble, Palestinians need help restoring homes, schools, hospitals, mosques and other institutions shattered by Israel's invasion. For Gaza's transitional administration to succeed, funding must flow quickly and security gaps be filled. Like much of Mr Trump's peace plan, references to an international stabilisation force and a proposed \"board of peace\", with Sir Tony Blair, are alarmingly vague.\n\nStrong international support for the Palestinian Authority, enabling it to take over from Hamas, is probably the most promising possibility. The enormous suffering of the past two years means the moral case for a resolution to the conflict is arguably more urgent than ever.

One of her best-loved songs and hailed as \"one of the greatest songs of all time\" by Rolling Stone, it became a hit all over again in 2022 when it featured in the fourth season of the US TV series Stranger Things.\n\nMaggi Hambling, once described as the \"original bad girl of art\" and Peter Doig, whose paintings have sold for millions, are among those to contribute works interpreting the lyric for the fundraiser Sound & Vision, named after David Bowie's 1977 hit. All the works will feature in an online auction, from 28 October to 13 November, with starting bids at £100 each, to raise money for the charity War Child, which protects, educates, and stands up for the rights of children living in war zones.\n\nAnnouncing the project, Bush said: \"All wars leave horrific scars; ruined lives, families ripped apart, life-changing injuries, trauma, and loss on a massive scale - but it's the children who suffer the most in so many ways. Their past, present and future melt away into fear and uncertainty.\n\n\"It is more important than ever we support War Child and their invaluable work providing immediate aid to children caught in conflict all over the world including in Ukraine, Gaza, Sudan and Syria. Projects like Sound & Vision harness the power of art and music to make a real difference to children living through war.\"\n\nDoig has contributed two signed pieces: The Hill, on the theme of the crucifixion, and Child of War depicting a child looking at a figure on horseback. Hambling's contribution is entitled Midnight Wave.\n\nCharlie Calder-Potts, Britain's youngest female official war artist who worked with the British army in Afghanistan, and who has since travelled the world creating work in Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan and at Yazidi refugee camps in Iraq, has created a new work.\n\nSo too have Corbin Shaw, known for textiles, prints and flags capturing modern-day Britishness through ancient crafts; Susie Hamilton, a former artist-in-residence at St Paul's Cathedral whose portraits of doctors, nurses and patients facing Covid-19 are held by the Science Museum; and Unskilled Worker, AKA Helen Downie, who discovered painting aged 48 and shot to industry-wide fame, growing an Instagram following of more than 280,000 followers.\n\nThe exhibition, curated by Art on a Postcard and sponsored by DHL, will go on display at Iconic Images Gallery in Piccadilly, London, from 4-8 November. Contributors also include LUAP, Hannah Lim, Kate McCrickard, Erin Lawlor, Gill Button, Adam Dix, David Harrison, Gideon Rubin, Boo Saville, Shezad Dawood, Natalia González Martín, while Peter Messer and Nick Grindrod will return after taking part in last year's Sound & Vision.\n\nBush follows in the footsteps of Bowie as a supporter of War Child. Bowie helped curate a fundraising exhibition for the charity in 1994 called Little Pieces from Big Stars, which 30 years later was the inspiration for the first Sound & Vision last year with artists responding to the lyric \"We like dancing and we look divine\" from his song Rebel Rebel.\n\nThe curator Gemma Peppé, the founder of Art on a Postcard, said Bush's lyric had \"prompted some great contemporary artists to produce some vibrant and evocative work\". She said Doig had asked if he could take part. \"I nearly fell off my chair. That's a testament to the great work War Child does.\"\n\nCharlotte Nimmo from War Child UK, which is present in a number of active conflict zones across the globe, including Ukraine and Gaza, said: \"We are delighted to announce that Sound & Vision is returning, this year inspired by lyrics from the incredible Kate Bush.

The cover picture, the president decreed, \"may be the Worst of All Time\".\n\nTime magazine's paean to Trump's role in brokering a Gaza ceasefire, leading its 10 November issue, was accompanied by a photo of the president taken from below and with the sun behind his head.\n\nThe result, he says, is \"super bad\".\n\n\"Time Magazine wrote a relatively good story about me, but the picture may be the Worst of All Time\", Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\n\"They \"disappeared\" my hair, and then had something floating on top of my head that looked like a floating crown, but an extremely small one. Really weird! I never liked taking pictures from underneath angles, but this is a super bad picture, and deserves to be called out. What are they doing, and why?\"\n\nTrump has made no secret of his desire to feature on Time's cover and did so four times last year. The obsession has made it as far as Trump's golf clubs - in 2017, the magazine asked him to remove mocked up covers on display at some of his properties.\n\nThe latest edition's photo was taken by Graeme Sloane for Bloomberg at the White House on 5 October.\n\nIts angle did no favours for Trump's chin and neck - an opportunity California governor Gavin Newsom did not miss, with his press office tweeting a version with the offending area pixelated.\n\nMeanwhile, a defence of the president's appearance has come from unusual quarters: the director of information at Russia's ministry of foreign affairs stepped in to criticise the \"self-incriminating\" image choice.\n\n\"It's astonishing: a photograph reveals far more about those who selected it than about the person in it. Only sick people, people obsessed with malice and hatred -perhaps even perverts - could have chosen such a photo\", Maria Zakharova wrote on Telegram.\n\n\"And given the complimentary photos of Biden that the same publication used on the cover, despite his physical infirmity, the story is simply self-incriminating for Time\", she said.\n\nThe answer to Trump's questions - what were Time's editors doing, and why? - may be something to do with creatively capturing a sense of power says Carly Earl, Guardian Australia's picture editor.\n\n\"The actual photo itself technically is good,\" she says. \"They picked this image because they wanted trump to look heroic. Staring up at someone gives a sense of their grandeur and Trump's face actually looks contemplative and almost slightly angelic. It's not often you see photos of Trump in such a serene moment - the image has a softness to it.\"\n\nTrump's hair appears to \"disappear\" because the sunlight behind him has overexposed that part of the image, creating a halo effect, she says. And, while the story's headline marries well with Trump's expression in the image, \"you can't always please the subject matter\".\n\n\"No one likes being photographed from below, and while all of the conceptual elements of the image are very strong, the aesthetics are not flattering.\"</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.19912120422087104,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Donald Trump\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"may be the Worst of All Time\",\n    \"message\": \"The cover picture of the magazine is considered to be the worst of all time.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Donald Trump\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"super bad\",\n    \"message\": \"The image is considered extremely bad.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Donald Trump\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"Time Magazine wrote a relatively good story about me, but the picture may be the Worst of All Time\",\n    \"message\": \"Time Magazine published a decent story about me, but the accompanying picture is possibly the worst ever.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Donald Trump\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"They \\\"disappeared\\\" my hair, and then had something floating on top of my head that looked like a floating crown, but an extremely small one.

US President Donald Trump could achieve the ultimate accolade, courtesy of his 20-point peace plan, of going down in history as the leader who finally managed to agree an enduring peace between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nThere is, of course, a long way to go before it will even be possible to judge whether Trump's ambitious peace initiative can achieve its numerous goals, starting with the challenging process of returning the remaining Israeli hostages, alive or not.\n\nWhile Hamas's terrorist leadership indicated its willingness to release the 20 Israeli hostages who have survived the ordeal of being held captive in the most inhumane conditions for two years, doubts remain about its intentions regarding the other 28 hostages who have died in captivity.\n\nThere have already been suggestions from the Hamas leadership that finding the remains of the dead hostages will be more difficult because they are held by different factions, and Hamas does not know where they are all located.\n\nThis could be a genuine drawback to Hamas's efforts to resolve the hostage issue. Or it could simply be another bargaining ploy by Hamas to draw out the hostage release process to buy it more time to regroup after the devastating losses it has suffered in recent months at the hands of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF).\n\nEven so, Trump deserves enormous credit for negotiating a deal that both aims to resolve once and for all the emotive hostage issue while at the same time brokering a ceasefire deal that could ultimately bring the Gaza conflict to an end.\n\nThat will certainly be the expectation when Trump, together with other world leaders, gather in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh tomorrow to discuss the American president's plan for ending the war.\n\nThe summit, hosted jointly by Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, will inevitably draw comparisons with other seminal moments in the long-running saga of Middle East diplomacy, such as the signing of the Camp David Accords between Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin in 1978 under the auspices of US President Jimmy Carter.\n\nThe agreement laid the foundations of the peaceful coexistence between Israel and Egypt that continues to this day, to the extent that Egypt played a critical role in the negotiations that ultimately resulted in Trump's peace plan. But tomorrow's attendees will also be well aware that the Camp David agreement came at a terrible price.\n\nWithin three years, Sadat had been assassinated by Egyptian Islamic Jihad, a group supporting the same nihilist Islamist ideology as Hamas.\n\nThe next major diplomatic initiative to bring peace to the Middle East, the 1993 Oslo Accords, had similarly tragic consequences.\n\nThe Accords were signed on the White House lawn in 1994 by Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat, the head of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, under the beaming gaze of President Bill Clinton.\n\nThis was the last time Israeli and Palestinian leaders managed to sign a peace deal, and the aim was to lay the foundations of a future independent Palestinian state.\n\nBut the fierce resistance the initiative generated on both sides of the conflict set in motion a new cycle of violence, starting with Rabin's assassination by a Jewish fanatic in November 1995. Soon afterwards Hamas launched a deadly series of terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians that ultimately resulted in the whole process being abandoned.\n\nThe shadow of previous Middle East initiatives will therefore hang heavily over tomorrow's proceedings in Sharm el-Sheikh, where Trump and other world leaders will be hoping that his peace plan has the potential to succeed where others, including subsequent attempts to revive the Oslo process, have so lamentably failed. Certainly, if Trump's plan does achieve its stated goals of ending the Gaza conflict and working towards the establishment of a Palestinian state, it will be an achievement of far greater significance than being awarded the Nobel Prize.\n\nThe scale of this daunting challenge, even with the hyperbole that inevitably surrounds any Trump initiative, should not be underestimated, as many significant obstacles need to be overcome before anything resembling progress in this latest Middle East peace initiative can be achieved.\n\nForemost among the obstacles that Trump and his allies must first overcome is the abiding lack of trust that permeates any dealings between Israel and Hamas, which meant that Hamas declined to be represented at tomorrow's discussions in Egypt. Instead the group focused its energy on last-minute haggling over the names of the Palestinian prisoners to be released in return for the Israeli hostages.\n\nAnd even if - and it is a big \"if\" - the hostage/prisoner exchange is completed in full, there are no guarantees that the two sides will move seamlessly to the next stage of the proceedings, whereby they agree a lasting end to hostilities in Gaza.\n\nIsraeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has set himself the Churchillian goal of achieving \"total victory\" over Hamas, will be well aware that Hamas, while agreeing to end the hostage crisis, has conveniently failed to respond to many of the other key elements in Trump's peace package, most importantly the requirement that it disarm and disband itself.\n\nHamas has already called up thousands of security personnel to operate in territory vacated by the Israeli military in Gaza, which hardly suggests that the terror group is minded to abandon its position.\n\nAnother key factor will be Trump's ability to use his influence to persuade Netanyahu to end military operations.\n\nThe American leader's ability to pressure Netanyahu to apologise for bombing Qatar - a key intermediary in the peace talks - appears to have been a seminal moment in achieving the breakthrough that resulted in the current stalemate, as it persuaded Hamas that Washington's guarantee that Israel would not resume hostilities would be respected. By giving up the hostages Hamas is, after all, giving up its one big bargaining chip.\n\nMaking sure Netanyahu keeps his word, especially if Hamas refuses to disarm, will undoubtedly pose a major challenge for Trump if his peace initiative is to achieve more than securing the release of the remaining Israeli hostages.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-2.9480640308277026,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Benjamin Netanyahu\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Israeli government\",\n    \"role\": \"Prime Minister\",\n    \"nationality\": \"ISR\",\n    \"quote\": \"total victory\",\n    \"message\": \"The goal is to achieve complete triumph over Hamas.\"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP"}],"createTime":"2025-10-15T10:37:35.022598Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"b3nvaMawAdmbm9IPz72j8AY","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":74,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":74}],"promptTokenCount":1613,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1613}],"thoughtsTokenCount":2061,"totalTokenCount":3748,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}}}

Anyone who failed to keep their eyes down was punished with a hit to the head.\"\n\nIsraeli forces intercepted all the boats of the Global Sumud flotilla (GSF), carrying more than 400 people including parliamentarians and the environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg, last week. Most of the people were held at Ketziot, a high-security prison in the Negev desert used primarily to detain Palestinians whom Israel accuses of involvement in terrorist activities.\n\nIsrael's foreign ministry has dismissed all claims of mistreatment of members of the flotilla as \"brazen lies\", posting on X on Sunday evening: \"All the detainees' legal rights are fully upheld.\"\n\nThe national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has said he was \"proud\" of the way staff behaved at Ketziot. He said in a statement on the activists: \"They should get a good feel for the conditions in Ketziot prison and think twice before they approach Israel again.\"\n\nRafael Borrego, a Spanish activist and lawyer, told Reuters: \"At any time that any of us called a police officer, we risked that seven or more fully armed people entered to our cell, as they did on mine, pointing us with weapons at our heads, with dogs ready to attack us, and being dragged to the floor. This happened on a daily basis.\"\n\nThe Australia and New Zealand branch of the Global Movement to Gaza, part of the flotilla, said the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) had notified the family of one participant that he had reported being assaulted during the interception of his vessel, receiving injuries to his shoulder and ribs.\n\nIt said the DFAT had been told the man was later attacked while in prison, slapped in the face, mocked and verbally abused, denied clean water and kept awake as guards shouted at him throughout the night.\n\nAda Colau, the leftwing former mayor of Barcelona, said on her return to Spain on Sunday night that the prison yard by her cell had been decorated with a huge photograph of a bombed-out Gaza, with a caption in Arabic that read: \"Welcome to the new Gaza.\"\n\nShe said it showed that the jail was \"the prison of a fascist state\". She said that when \"we asked for a doctor, we were told that that was for humans\".\n\nLorenzo D'Agostino, an Italian journalist, told the Guardian there were crew members who had urgently needed medication. \"The Israelis ignored them,\" he said. \"When we all protested, they came in wearing riot gear, set dogs on us and aimed the laser sights of their automatic rifles at our heads.\"\n\nHe added: \"When they stripped us of our shirts and of Palestinian symbols like the keffiyeh, they stamped on them forcefully.\"\n\nD'Agostino and several other members of the flotilla said Israeli forces appeared to single out Thunberg for harsher treatment than the others. \"I saw with my own eyes that they draped an Israeli flag over her while soldiers took selfies with her. Greta is a strong and courageous woman, but during detention she looked deeply shaken,\" D'Agostino said.\n\nAn email sent by the Swedish foreign ministry and seen by the Guardian confirmed that the activist had been forced \"to hold flags\" and had been \"detained in a cell infested with bedbugs, with too little food and water\".\n\nThe Israeli foreign ministry statement said Thunberg \"did not complain to the Israeli authorities about any of these ludicrous and baseless allegations - because they never occurred\".\n\nThe campaigner will be among more than 70 people of different nationalities to leave Israel on Monday on a flight to Athens.\n\nIsrael has so far deported at least 170 of the more than 450 activists it detained. The last of the 49 Spaniards who sailed with the flotilla were expected to fly back to Spain on Monday.\n\nTwenty-seven Greek nationals including a leftwing MP, Peti Perka, were due to return home later on Monday after Athens' foreign ministry announced it would dispatch a specially chartered plane to southern Israel's Eilat-Ramon international airport.\n\nGreece's centre-right government has faced mounting criticism over its hesitation to criticise Israel, with opposition parties and relatives of the activists accusing the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, of prioritising the two countries' \"strategic alliance\".\n\nThe Greek foreign ministry lodged \"a strong written protest\" on Friday in which it called on Israel \"to promptly complete the required procedures [of repatriation] and to respect the rights of the citizens involved\", but opponents noted that it was only issued after complaints of official indifference by the activists' relatives.\n\nStopping short of naming Ben-Gvir, who was filmed taunting the activists as they came ashore, the ministry criticised \"the unacceptable and inappropriate behaviour of an Israeli minister directed against Greek citizens\".\n\nMeanwhile, a new flotilla that set sail from Turkey is making its way toward Gaza and is about 200 nautical miles from the territory. It is carrying about 250 people including doctors, nurses and journalists on a ferry converted into a floating hospital.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.6828789683435693,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Saverio Tommasi\",\n    \"organisation\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"Journalist\",\n    \"nationality\": \"ITA\",\n    \"quote\": \"I was beaten from the moment we entered the port until the very end.

Sign up for Five Great Reads here.\n\nGood morning. This week brought the two-year anniversary of the Hamas attack into Israel and the war in Gaza. The past 48 hours has seen a ceasefire deal many hope could bring a halt to the violence - though as one diplomat involved in the talks said: \"The tragedy is that this could have all been agreed 20 months ago.\"\n\nThis weekly round-up of essential reads begins with a sober view on the conflict from the Guardian's global diplomatic editor. There's also some lighter fare.\n\nI hope you find something here that makes you think.\n\nDonald Trump may have claimed success in Gaza, but as Patrick Wintour writes, \"The destruction, the death toll and the spillover of the conflict into other countries is a monument to shame diplomacy and what remains of international law.\"\n\nThere's a growing consensus across the west ... \"that this conflict was desperately mishandled, including by European leaders who initially ceded responsibility to a US Democratic administration that romanticised modern Israel\".\n\nAnd a major shift in thinking: \"We have changed the mindset,\" French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, said after Arab states in September backed the exclusion of Hamas from Gaza. \"Everyone now sees Hamas for what they are: a terrorist organisation.\"\n\nIn 1996, police crashed into the London home that Mary Attenborough, an academic (specialty: geophysical software), shared with Michael Gallagher (former civil servant, helped homeless alcoholics). When he was arrested on suspicion of IRA activity, she was shocked and indignant. Then he was charged, convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison.\n\nHe only confessed to her after his conviction.\n\nThey're still together. And have co-written a book, confirming, as Ireland correspondent Rory Carroll reports, that Gallagher \"was, in fact, guilty - that he was an IRA fixer who facilitated multiple operations, including the Heathrow attack\".\n\nThe real betrayal? Gallagher had once wowed Attenborough by completing the Guardian's cryptic crossword in three minutes. But while writing the book, he disclosed another decades-old secret: before speedily completing the crossword in her copy of the Guardian, he had done it earlier in his own.\n\nHow long will it take to read: two minutes\n\nJohn McAvoy's stepfather was a serious criminal. His uncle was in a heist gang - and played by Sean Bean in the film Fool's Gold. McAvoy followed them into crime, and into England's harshest prisons. But as Chris Godfrey finds out, in the prison gym, McAvoy found the route to turn things around.\n\nNow he's a serious athlete and a campaigner for prison reform. He empathises with teenagers who have romanticised criminal and gang life: \"It's a very toxic, horrible world. Once you get in it, it's very difficult to remove yourself from it ... I understand how they can get sucked into that world.\"\n\n\"Even though I was young, I could tell the stuff he had on was very expensive.\" - John McAvoy remembering meeting his stepfather, also an armed robber, at the age of eight.\n\nHow long will it take to read: eight-and-a-half minutes\n\nApropos of flashy money: no one writes about it like Jilly Cooper, who died this week after 88 years and some 11m books sold. As Zoe Williams writes, her raunchy, tightly-written romances are a category unto themselves: not just about sex (there's an abundance), money (also plenty of that), Tory-coded social mores (lots of those, too), or the lush, frothy beauty of the English countryside (constant). As Olivia Laing points out, significant slabs of these novels are devoted to the slog of work. And loving animals.\n\nI bought my first Jilly Cooper in the secondhand section of a bookshop I worked at in my twenties: mid-shift, my friend Octavia and I saw our names splashed in yellow and orange across two of those soft-focus covers - hard to believe, impossible to resist.\n\nHow long will it take to read: this article? Less than four minutes. But consider, if you will, The Rutshire Chronicles audiobooks - hundreds of hours drifting through space to the fruity tones of Sherry Baines's narration. Can't recommend enough.\n\nFurther reading: A real-life story from this week worthy of Dame Jilly ... Juhea Kim was working 80-hour weeks in New York - 31, single, and burned out. Could a string of dates with French men bring back her joie de vivre?\n\nBetween 2022 and 2023, dozens of rare editions of Russian classics were stolen from libraries across Europe. As one Estonian prosecutor reflects: \"Libraries just aren't used to thinking of themselves as targets for major crime.\" But was it low-level opportunists, or something more sinister? The Guardian's Europe culture editor, Philip Oltermann, dives in.\n\nThe tactic: two people would use fake IDs to order up rare books from the stacks. If they were being watched, one would distract the librarians while the other walked out.\n\nThe common denominator: the work of early 19th-century Romantic poet and playwright Alexander Pushkin.\n\nHow long will it take to read: 12 or so minutes\n\nA more local literary puzzle: Elizabeth Harrower wrote some of Australia's best novels, then disappeared for decades. As her biographer Susan Wyndham puts it, even she wasn't sure why. (Bonus book rec: Harrower's In Certain Circles.)\n\nEnjoying the Five Great Reads email?

And why not? The Nobel committee is meeting in Oslo to divvy up its annual gongs and Donald Trump, convening his cabinet - and the media - in the White House had a good story to tell.\n\nAfter two years of death, destruction, starvation and captivity for Israeli hostages in Gaza, peace at last was at hand. Israel and Hamas were on the brink of a historic deal, brokered by the man in the Oval Office, who has made no secret of his desire to be known as the president of peace.\n\nThe stakes in Gaza are so gravely baleful that it would be churlish to ascribe selfish motives to the cabinet meeting's main theme.\n\nYet the timing was, shall we say, serendipitous.\n\nToday is Thursday, tomorrow Friday - by coincidence, the day the winner of the Nobel will be announced.\n\nBut Trump, whose previous expressions of desire for the same prize awarded to Barack Obama have bordered on the avaricious, was all decorum and restraint - at least on that narrow issue alone.\n\nIn the course of a 70-minute meeting, the N word went unmentioned - apart from by one journalist near the end, whose question about Trump's views on the prize went unanswered.\n\nThere was going to be \"peace in the Middle East\", he said portentously.\n\n\"I think it's going to be a lasting peace, hopefully an everlasting peace,\" he added, no ambition being too great.\n\n\"It will be a day of joy,\" the president said, when the remaining living Israeli hostages - believed to be 20 in number - are released on Monday or Tuesday.\n\n\"They're dancing in the streets. They're so happy. Everybody's happy. They're dancing in the streets of Arab countries, Muslim countries, I've never seen anything like it.\"\n\nEveryone around him deserved credit, the president said magnanimously. \"JD [Vance], you were fantastic. And Pete [Hegseth], you were great. Marco [Rubio] was fantastic. I mean, some of you were very much involved. I think almost everybody in this room was involved. Susie [Wiles, the White House chief of staff], I want to thank you very much. You were incredible ... and then you have Steve Witkoff [his personal envoy].\"\n\nBut it fell to Rubio, the secretary of state and acting national security adviser, to supply the heavy hint to the Nobel committee in Norway.\n\n\"I don't know if the one day perhaps the entire story will be told about the events of yesterday, but suffice it to say - it's not an exaggeration - that none of it would have been possible without the president. Without the president of the United States being involved,\" enthused the man once disparaged by Trump as \"little Marco\".\n\nThat drew a round of applause from the cabinet - the second of the meeting, the first being for Trump's announcement at the beginning that a national holiday on the second Monday of October would henceforth be known as Columbus Day.\n\nRubio warmed to his theme. The achievement transcended dry geopolitics to encapsulate the person of Trump himself.\n\n\"Yesterday was a human story,\" he said. \"And because of the work you put in. And honestly, not only is there no other leader in the world that could have put this together, Mr President, but frankly, I don't know of any American president in the modern era that could have made this possible because of the actions you have taken unrelated to this, and because of who you are, and what you've done, and how you're viewed.\"\n\nBut this was still a Trump cabinet meeting, and it would not have been complete without some dissonant notes.\n\nThey were duly supplied by the jarring contrast between the promise of peace and harmony in the Middle East and the darkening prospect of war, or at least civil disharmony, in America.\n\nTrump only had good words to say about countries in the Middle East who were he said were on board with his peace deal - even Iran, a country which he recently bombed but now said he wanted to see rebuilt.\n\nBut here at home an \"enemy from within\" had to be confronted. Troops were to be deployed onto the streets of US cities to show elected local Democratic mayors and governors who was boss.\n\nKristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, reported going to Portland and meeting the governor, mayor, chief of police and highway patrol superintendent.\n\n\"They are all lying and disingenuous and dishonest people,\" she declared, charitably, \"because as soon as you leave the room, then they make the exact opposite response.\" This presumably because the officials named depicted their city in somewhat more peaceful terms than the warzone of Noem et al's fevered narrative.\n\nYet taking the prize for low blows was JD Vance, who understood that the unifying theme of the meeting was Trump's nascent success in ending bloodshed in the Middle East - yet failed to grasp that this call for a display of graciousness on his part.\n\nThe vice-president has been known at cabinet gatherings to double up with contrived laughter at his boss's jokes.\n\nThis time he decided the best policy was to repurpose for his own use one of Trump's tried-and-tested jibes - at the expense of Chuck Schumer, the Democrats' leader in the Senate.\n\n\"The one thing I would say is obviously the president of the United States, a New York real estate billionaire, one of the most famous New Yorkers in the world, has a lot of interaction with a lot of people who are very pro-Israel,\" said Vance.\n\nThen, perhaps realizing that he could not reach the giddy heights of Rubio's testimonial, he added: \"He also, of course, knew one of the most famous Palestinians in the world, Chuck Schumer.\"\n\nThe crack provoked laughter. It is one of Trump's cruelest taunts against Schumer, a fellow New Yorker who is proudly Jewish and a staunch supporter of Israel. Given the current backdrop, retreading it at this point struck a particularly discordant note.\n\nJD, it seems, has secret aspirations as a king of comedy. A calling missed, perhaps. But someone needs to tell him about timing - and context.</article>"}],"role":"user"}]},"response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.4036080947172471,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Donald Trump\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Government of the United States\",\n    \"role\": \"President\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"I think it's going to be a lasting peace, hopefully an everlasting peace,\",\n    \"message\": \"I believe that the peace in the Middle East will be lasting and potentially everlasting.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Donald Trump\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Government of the United States\",\n    \"role\": \"President\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"It will be a day of joy,\",\n    \"message\": \"The release of the remaining 20 Israeli hostages will be a day of joy.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Donald Trump\",\n    \"organisation\": \"Government of the United States\",\n    \"role\": \"President\",\n    \"nationality\": \"USA\",\n    \"quote\": \"They're dancing in the streets.
